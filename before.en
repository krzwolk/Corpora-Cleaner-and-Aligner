Rewrite was announced on April 1, 2008,[25] which led to some speculation whether it was an April Fool's joke or an actual announcement of Key's new game.[26] It was announced the following day on Key's blog that production on Rewrite had begun.[26][27] On April 1, 2010, Rewrite's official website was updated with the announcement that the game would be an adult game, but this turned out to be an April Fool's joke the following day.[26] It was later reported by Key in February 2011 that an adult version of Rewrite would definitely not be produced.[28] On April 1, 2011, Key released an anime video featuring the song "Rewrite" by Psychic Lover.

Rewrite is also the first Key game to be developed on Visual Art's' game engine Siglus.[18] The project's planning was headed by Itaru Hinoue, who is also the art director and character designer for Rewrite.[19] During the time when Key was developing their fifth game Tomoyo After: It's a Wonderful Life in 2005, Hinoue had more free time since she was just helping Fumio with the character design, and that is when Hinoue got the initial idea for Rewrite.[20] Hinoue wrote a proposal for the basis of Rewrite's premise and passed it on to Takahiro Baba, the president of Visual Art's.[21]
She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth.[15] Kotori, who is a summoner, is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars.

Development[edit]
Rewrite marked the first time since Key's third game Clannad that Itaru Hinoue was staffed as the sole art director and character designer in a Key visual novel.[22] The school uniforms for the heroines in the game are old designs that Hinoue created and used before in dōjinshi (self-published work).[20] In particular, Hinoue spent much time on drawing the character art in Rewrite due in part to the design of the school uniforms, the fact that most of the female characters have long hair, and because of the increased aspect ratio.[21] Six more graphic artists worked on Rewrite: Torino headed the background art, Ryou Shigawa designed and illustrated the monsters, and the computer graphics in the game were done by Na-Ga, Shinory, Mochisuke, and Minimo Tayama.[1] The game's soundtrack was composed by Key's signature composers Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito, in addition to Maiko Iuchi of I've Sound, Sōshi Hosoi, and Ryō Mizutsuki.[19] Maeda also contributed on the quality control for the game.[19]

When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrite's overall story.[22]
At the time, the only other scenario writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!.[24] Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework,[20] and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route be added to the story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer.[22] Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite.[20] Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route.

On 17 April 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Dr. Rudolph Nissen in 1948.[84] He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.[85]
In February 1933 while on a visit to the United States, Einstein decided not to return to Germany due to the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany's new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.[59][60] He visited American universities in early 1933 where he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.

Peter Debye refined this model.[103] Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables
In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions.[27] There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his celebrated 1905 papers,[28][29] but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.[30][31][32][33]
Einstein saw this wave-particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. Theory of critical opalescence
This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.[123] On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator.
In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") theory was the result of these investigations.
He stated in the paper, ''"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time."
This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.
In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum.
Thus, the average density of the system never changed.

Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification.
At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left Germany seven years later.[11] Contrary to popular suggestions that he had struggled with early speech difficulties, the Albert Einstein Archives indicate he excelled at the first school that he attended.[12] He was right-handed;[12][13] there appears to be no evidence for the widespread popular belief[14] that he was left-handed.
Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics. Wave–particle duality
After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.
When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium.
In 1916, Einstein was appointed president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918).[49][50]
In May 1904, the couple's first son, Hans Albert Einstein, was born in Bern, Switzerland.
Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.
He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

To fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the cosmological constant, which he called ''Lambda''.[108] The purpose of Lambda was to rectify the effects of gravity and allow the whole system to stay balanced.
Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it. This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics.
But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.[102]

As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell's theorem, which had been promulgated in 1964.
In 1894, his father's company failed: direct current (DC) lost the War of Currents to alternating current (AC).
Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant.
The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.
This argument is called the Equivalence principle.
In 1917, Einstein applied the General theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole.
At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.[19] It was during his time in Italy that he wrote a short essay with the title "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field."[20][21]
He became a full professor at Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in 1911.
While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory.
He had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields, but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever.
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940.
He wrote to Stephen Brunauer, the research chemist who recruited him, that he hoped to avoid visits to Washington, D.C., "knowing that I would be very much molested by snobbish people".[77]

Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.[119] It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.[120] Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons.
After graduating, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post.
Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view.

They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes.
In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern.[104] In "über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung" ("The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles.

On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown".[51] Much later, questions were raised whether the measurements had been accurate enough to support Einstein's theory.
Other investigations
These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.
He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity.
With so many other Jewish scientists now forced by circumstances to live in America, often working side by side, Einstein wrote to a friend, "For me the most beautiful thing is to be in contact with a few fine Jews—a few millennia of a civilized past do mean something after all."
His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate German culture.
He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination,[22] but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics.[23] On the advice of the Principal of the Polytechnic, he attended the Aargau Cantonal School in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895–96 to complete his secondary schooling.
It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II.
This principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics.
 "He was greeted with great British pomp, as if he were a head of state rather than a theoretical physicist", writes Isaacson.
Today, I have been made happy by the sight of the Jewish people learning to recognize themselves and to make themselves recognized as a force in the world.[58]:308
The research paper was titled ''"Zum kosmologischen Problem"'' ("About the Cosmological Problem").[113][114] And Einstein proposed a revision of his model, still with a cosmological constant, but now the constant was responsible for the creation of new matter as the universe expanded.
This argument, which was made in 1913 in collaboration with Otto Stern, was based on the thermodynamics of a diatomic molecule which can split apart into two free atoms.

Mach's principle has generated much controversy over the years.
The letter is believed to be "arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II".[73] In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family[74] and the Belgian queen mother[69] to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office.[69] President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first.

In that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.
He then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.
In 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator.
In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin, while his wife remained in Zurich with their sons.

According to Isaacson, he recognized the "right of individuals to say and think what they pleased", without social barriers, and as a result, the individual was "encouraged" to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education. Einstein wrote:[58]:432
The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science.[125][126][127] Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox Main article: EPR paradox In 1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.
His father once showed him a pocket compass; Einstein realized that there must be something causing the needle to move, despite the apparent "empty space".[15] As he grew, Einstein built models and mechanical devices for fun and began to show a talent for mathematics.[10] When Einstein was ten years old, Max Talmud (later changed to Max Talmey), a poor Jewish medical student from Poland, was introduced to the Einstein family by his brother.
With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.
Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.
By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist, and he was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern.
In 1980 historians John Earman and Clark Glymour published an analysis suggesting that Eddington had suppressed unfavorable results.[52] The two reviewers found possible flaws in Eddington's selection of data, but their doubts, although widely quoted and, indeed, now with a "mythical" status almost equivalent to the status of the original observations, have not been confirmed.[53][54] Eddington's selection from the data seems valid and his team indeed made astronomical measurements verifying the theory.[55]
Photons and energy quanta
His affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955.[68] He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel.
Before, I have always found something to regret in the Jewish soul, and that is the forgetfulness of its own people.

In 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington of ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group's warnings were discounted.[69] Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, "regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."[57]:630[70] On July 12, 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein[71] and they explained the possibility of atomic bombs, to which pacifist Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht ("I had not thought of that at all").[72] Einstein was persuaded to lend his prestige by writing a letter with Szilárd to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to alert him of the possibility.
In 1921, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, as relativity was considered still somewhat controversial.
In October 1933 he returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton, New Jersey), that required his presence for six months each year.[64][65] He was still undecided on his future (he had offers from European universities, including Oxford), but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.[66][67]
Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.
His travels included Singapore, Ceylon, and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese.
During 1911, he had calculated that, based on his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity.
They divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years.
During one reception given to him, the building was "stormed by throngs who wanted to hear him".
He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.
Academic career
There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn."[90]
Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made.
Also in 1911, corrections of algebraic errors in his thesis brought Einstein's Avogadro constant estimate to 6.6×1023.
This included a cannon salute upon his arrival at the residence of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel.
Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the Polytechnic that same year, the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course.
I have done my share, it is time to go.
In 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles.

Their second son, Eduard, was born in Zurich in July 1910.
Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich.
He became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

In 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article, in which additional effects such as the deflection of light by massive bodies were predicted.
These included Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Euclid's Elements (which Einstein called the "holy little geometry book").[16][17][fn 1]
He and his wife Elsa returned by ship to Belgium at the end of March.
Einstein and Marić married in January 1903.
His dissertation was entitled "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions."[44][45] This paper included Einstein's initial estimates of Avogadro constant as 2.2×1023 based on diffusion coefficients and viscosities of sugar solutions in water.[46] That same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world.
(Albert's sister Maja later married Wintelers' son Paul.)[24] In January 1896, with his father's approval, he renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service.[25] In September 1896, he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1-6,[26] and, though only seventeen, enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic.
He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House.

While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.
He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in strict rote learning.
In 1914, he returned to Germany after being appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (1914–1932)[48] and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, with a special clause in his contract that freed him from most teaching obligations.

He modified Planck's hypothesis by stating that the lowest energy state of an oscillator is equal to 1⁄2hf, to half the energy spacing between levels.
Other scientists also fled to America. Among them were Nobel laureates and professors of theoretical physics.

During the voyage they were informed that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat had been confiscated.
He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901,[37] but was not conscripted for medical reasons.
The letter also recommended that the U.S. government pay attention to and become directly involved in uranium research and associated chain reaction research.
What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein "displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply.
He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.[2]

Maria Kalergis (Maria Kalergis-Muchanow, née Maria Nesselrode; Warsaw, 7 August 1822 – 22 May 1874, Warsaw) was a countess, Polish pianist and patron of the arts.
Contents [hide] 1 Life
2 Descendants 3 Notes
4 References 5 External links Life[edit]
At the age of seventeen Maria Nesselrode married Jan Kalergis, a rich landowner, who was much older and proved to be of a jealous disposition.
Though they had a daughter, Marie, born in 1840 in Saint Petersburg, less than a year after their wedding they mutually decided to separate.
Despite several attempts to overcome their aversion for each other, they would continue living separately, without divorcing, until Jan's death.
He ensured Maria a prosperous life; to be sure, after their separation the division of their assets was in dispute, but they did allow her to tour Europe, including Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, Paris and Baden-Baden.
The course of Maria's marriage may have been influenced by her childhood experiences.
A year after her birth, her father, Fryderyk Karol Nesselrode (of German descent) and his wife Tekla Nałęcz-Górska (of Polish descent), had separated due to personality differences.
From her sixth year, Maria had been reared in Saint Petersburg in the home of her paternal uncle, Karl Robert Nesselrode, a Russian diplomat of German descent who for forty years (1816–56) was the Tsar's minister of foreign affairs and who saw to it that Maria received a thorough education.
She may have inherited her musical talent from her parents, and for a while took lessons from Chopin, who praised her talent.
She was taught Polish by her mother and also spoke French (then the language of Polish salons), German, English, Italian and Russian.
She is remembered as the great love of Cyprian Norwid.
For her, the acquaintance with the young poet was but one of many episodes in an active social life.
He, shy and deferential, withdrew into the shade of the beautiful Maria's other admirers.
For many years he harbored feelings for her that more than once served him as a source of poetic inspiration.
He confided his feelings in letters to Maria Trembicka (General Stanisław Tręmbicki's daughter who later married a man named Faleński), a close friend of the "white siren."
Encouraged by his confidante's friendship, he proposed to Maria Kalergis but was not accepted.
From 1847 she lived in Paris, then from 1857 in Warsaw.
Guests at her salons included Liszt, Richard Wagner (who addressed his infamous essay Das Judentum in der Musik to her), de Musset, Moniuszko, Gautier, Heine (who dedicated his poem "The White Elephant" to her) and Chopin.
Back in Warsaw she became a patroness of the arts and took part in charity fund-raising concerts and theatrical performances.
Her resources were always available to those in need.
When Stanisław Moniuszko wanted to premiere the four-act version of his opera Halka in Warsaw, he was opposed by the director of the Warsaw government theaters, Siergiej Muchanow (who was also the Warsaw chief of police and in 1863 would become Maria's second husband).
Thanks to Maria's intervention, Moniuszko managed to get the opera put on.
Three months after the January 1858 opening, she organized a concert to benefit Moniuszko, who was having financial difficulties.
The concert raised 25,000 Polish złotych, which enabled the composer to meet his basic needs and take a journey abroad.
Maria Kalergis had an appreciable influence on the development of musical culture, helping found the Warsaw Musical Institute (now the Warsaw Conservatory) and founding with Moniuszko the Warsaw Musical Society, now the Warsaw Philharmonic.
In 1857–71 she frequently appeared as a pianist.
Soon after her husband's death in 1863, she married Siergiej Muchanow, ten years her junior.
He was with her during her illness and nursed her devotedly through her final days.
It was probably then that, sensing the approaching end of her life, Maria destroyed her correspondence.
Her letters to her daughter, son-in-law and friends have survived, however, and have made it possible to reconstruct many facts about her life and are a valuable source of knowledge about the period.
She was interred at Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery. On her death, Liszt wrote his Elegy on Marie Kalergi.[1]
Descendants[edit] Maria Kalergis' grandson, Jan Henryk Maria Count Coudenhove, with Emperor Franz Josef's permission, changed his surname to Coudenhove-Calergi.
He married a Japanese lady, Mitsuko Aoyama.
Their son, Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, in 1923 founded the Paneuropean Union.

USS Tautog (SS-199), a Tambor-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tautog, a small edible sport fish, which is also called a blackfish.
The sound of approaching high-speed propellers and a closing patrol plane convinced the submarine that it was time to depart.
The submarine approached the wreckage and rescued one survivor who identified the ship as the motor torpedo boat tender Shuri Maru (1,800 tons),[37] en route from Tsingtao to Sasebo.
Tautog maneuvered to silhouette the target against the moon and attacked with two torpedoes and then watched the ship sink.
Her score for the patrol was three ships for 8,500 tons (postwar, two for 3,300).[38]
Tautog completed her patrol at Midway on 1 February 1945 and was assigned to training duty.
One hit blew off the enemy's bow.
She fired another torpedo from a range of 700 yards (640 m); and the loaded troopship, Transport Number 15, disintegrated.
1 Construction
She transferred to the Atlantic in November 1945, a few months after Japan's surrender, and was decommissioned in December.
On 11 January, Tautog intercepted two freighters and launched three torpedoes at the first and larger, and one at the second.
On 2 August, Tautog sighted several ships off Miki Saki.
On 11 November, she launched a torpedo at another passenger/cargo ship.
Eleventh patrol[edit]
She launched three torpedoes at a freighter from a range of 800 yards (730 m).
The submarine launched four torpedoes from a range of 2,000 yards (1,800 m).
During the night of 2 November, Tautog laid mines off Haiphong, Indochina, with several exploding as they were emplaced.
The first hit caused a secondary explosion which obscured the target, and the second raised a column of black smoke.
On 13 March, Tautog tracked a freighter until she reached a good position for an attack and then launched three torpedoes from 1,500 yards (1,400 m), of which two hit and stopped Ryua Maru.
On 13 January 1942, she launched three torpedoes at a small minelayer, receiving a depth charging in return.
The next day, Tautog damaged a tanker but could not evaluate the damage as she had to evade enemy escorts that were approaching.
On her way back to Midway Island, the submarine sank a wooden trawler with her deck guns.
On 2 March, the submarine shifted her operations to Pearl Harbor to assist aircraft in anti-submarine warfare for one month before heading for the United States.
She attained a position and fired a spread of three torpedoes.
On 27 October, Tautog tracked a passenger-cargo ship until dark and launched two torpedoes into her.
On 8 May, amid "swarms of ships"[31] the submarine contacted a convoy bound for Esan Saki.
2 Operational history
The next day, Tautog was patrolling on the surface near Simusu Shima, when she sighted a ship coming over the horizon.
On 20 May, she sank a sampan with her deck guns.
On 20 October, her lookouts spotted the dim outline of a ship through a rain squall.
The bright moonlight of 20 January disclosed an enemy ship at a range of 10,000 yards (9,100 m).
Tautog sighted two ships departing Truk on 22 May and made a submerged sound attack on the larger.
On 22 October, she surfaced near Fais Island to shell a phosphate plant.
She fired torpedoes at the largest ship.
On 9 April 1942, Tautog headed westward toward Hawaii and started her next war patrol upon leaving Pearl Harbor 15 days later.
Three days later, Tautog made an attack from periscope depth against a cargo ship.
Tautog's first war patrol began on 26 December 1941 and took her to the Marshall Islands for reconnaissance work.
Around 10:00 on 26 April near Johnston Island, while en route to her station, Tautog sighted the periscope of an enemy submarine, apparently maneuvering to reach a favorable firing position.
On 17 January 1945, Tautog sighted a ship heading toward her.
On 27 December, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a freighter and made a similar attack on a passenger ship.
The Filipinos swam over to the submarine and later enlisted in the United States Navy.
Fifth patrol[edit]
The submarine ran up her periscope, but an explosion filled the air with debris and obscured Saishu Maru from view as the freighter sank.
3 First patrol
Her third war patrol, conducted from 17 July to 10 September 1942, took Tautog to the coast of Indochina, where (in part due to torpedo shortages) she laid mines.
She sank Submarine Chaser Number 30 on 4 November.[28] and subsequently damaged a tanker and three cargo ships.
4 Second patrol
Fourth patrol[edit]
5 Third patrol
On 5 January 1943, Tautog sighted a sail off her port bow and promptly closed the ship. It turned out to be a native craft with a dozen Muslim sailors, four women, several babies, some chickens, and a goat on board.
 "Barney" Sieglaff, on his first war patrol)[19] to the Java Sea, near Ambon Island, Timor Island, and Celebes Island.
She submerged, closed the range, identified the ship as a coastal steamer.
On 6 June, the submarine fired a spread of three torpedoes at a cargo ship off the entrance to Basalin Strait.
Surfacing, the sub fired 21 5" shells into the target, starting a fire and causing an explosion that blew off the target's stern.
Tautog's next patrol was conducted in Makassar Strait and around Balikpapan (where she again laid mines)[24] from 24 February 1943 to 19 April.
On 7 September, she headed for San Francisco to join the Pacific Reserve Fleet.
Tautog stood out of Fremantle on 11 May 1943 and headed for a patrol area that included the Flores Sea, the Gulf of Boni, the Molucca Sea, the Celebes Sea, and the Moru Gulf.
On 7 October 1943, Tautog departed Pearl Harbor to patrol in waters near the Palau Islands.
She then rescued six survivors from a swamped lifeboat who identified their ship as the Hokoriu Maru, en route from the Bonin Islands to Tokyo laden with coconut oil.
On 9 January at 08:38, Tautog (relying on ULTRA) sighted a Natori-class cruiser off Ambon Island, at a range of about 3,000 yards (2,700 m).
Tautog's ninth war patrol began on 12 December 1943 and took her to Japanese home waters, southeast of Shikoku Island and along the southern coast of Honshū.
Later in the morning, Tautog sighted another submarine with the designation "I-28" clearly discernible on its conning tower.[12] Just as I-28 fired at Tautog, the American boat launched two torpedoes, then went to 150 feet (46 m) to avoid.[10] One torpedo missed,[10] the second sent the Japanese boat to the bottom,[12] making her the third sunk by Pacific Fleet submarines.[13]
When Tautog returned to Pearl Harbor, she was credited with four ships sunk for 20,500 tons (postwar reduced to 16,100).[34]
On 21 October, she and Thresher (SS-200) stood out to sea, under sealed orders, to begin a 45-day, full-time, simulated war patrol in the area of Midway Island.
She called at Midway and Saipan before taking her patrol station (in company with Silversides)[36] in the East China Sea.
Her spread of torpedoes sent Shoka Maru to the bottom. The patrol ended at Fremantle on 11 June.
She also laid mines off Haiphong and suffered through a depth charge attack in November 1942.
Tautog arrived there on 10 August, credited with a disappointing two ships for 4,300 tons (postwar reduced to 2,800);[35] she was routed to the United States for overhaul.
Tautog was officially credited with sinking Shirakumo (1,750 tons)[32] and the passenger/cargo ship Nichiren Maru, bringing her total for the patrol to five ships for 17,700 tons (reduced postwar to four for 11,300),[33] one of the most aggressive, and successful, of the war.
An hour later, Tautog fired two more and scored another hit. The 5,973-ton Army cargo ship Ryoyo Maru[31] settled in 24 feet (7.3 m) of water, decks awash.
Eighth patrol[edit]
The next morning, Tautog made radar contact in a heavy fog, closing the enemy ship and firing four torpedoes; two hit the target.
The Japanese were ordered to take to their boats but refused to do so. Three shells fired in the schooner's stern disabled her rudder and propeller.
Two hits sent Banshu Alaru Number 2 to the bottom.
The target refused to sink, even after Tautog fired four more torpedoes into "the rubber ship".[31] To avoid wasting more precious torpedoes, the submarine surfaced and finished the job with her 5" gun.
She returned to New London, Connecticut and operated from that base until early February 1941 when she was ordered to the Virgin Islands.
After calls at Coco Solo, Canal Zone, and San Diego, California, they arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 June 1941.
For 38 consecutive days, the two submarines operated submerged for 16 to 18 hours each day.
Third patrol[edit]
The submarine circled for a follow-up shot, but this was difficult as the water was covered with gasoline drums, debris, and life rafts.
She was launched on 27 January 1940 (sponsored by Mrs. Richard S. Edwards), and commissioned on 3 July 1940 with Lieutenant Joseph H. Willingham (Class of 1926)[6] in command.
First patrol[edit]
Second patrol[edit]
Tautog expended three additional torpedoes on a freighter, but missed.[25] On 9 April in the Celebes Sea off Boston Island, Tautog contacted a convoy of five ships.
On 8 July, she stopped a small freighter dead in the water with one spread of torpedoes and followed with another spread that sank the ship.
The victim was later identified as Hasshu Maru, a former Dutch passenger-cargo ship which had been taken over by the Japanese.
Sold some months later, she was scrapped at Manistee, Michigan, during the early 1960s.
A profligate spread of six torpedoes produced four hits which broke Usa Maru in half.
After 26 days in the area gathering information, particularly of Kwajalein, she reported no enemy activity at Rongelop, Bat, Wotho, or Bikini.
Tautog was back in Pearl Harbor in early December and, on 17 December 1944, began her 13th and last war patrol.
The submarine was towed to Wisconsin and arrived at Milwaukee on 26 December 1947. She provided immobile service at the Great Lakes Naval Reserve Training Center for the next decade.
Later in the patrol, in the Salajar Strait, Tautog spotted a second cruiser (again thanks to ULTRA), and launched four torpedoes in heavy seas; all missed.[21] She sighted a freighter on 22 January in the Banda Sea, and three of the submarine's torpedoes sent her to the bottom.
On 2 May, she sighted a cargo ship in a small harbor between Banjo To and Matsuwa To.
Two days later, on Sunday, 7 December, Tautog was at the Submarine Base when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
8 Sixth patrol 9 Seventh patrol
6 Fourth patrol 7 Fifth patrol
This patrol was no more successful; despite six torpedo and three gun attacks, she only sank two confirmed ships for 14,300 tons (reduced to 5,300 tons postwar).[27] The submarine was then routed back to the United States for an overhaul at Hunter's Point Navy Yard.
Shortly after her arrival in the Marshalls, Tautog was ordered to Truk to intercept ships returning from the Battle of the Coral Sea, especially the Japanese aircraft carriers Zuikauku and Shōkaku (the latter codenamed "Wounded Bear");[9] because Pearl Harbor underestimated Shōkaku's speed, Tautog and two compatriots arrived too late and did not see Shōkaku depart, on 11 or 12 May.[10] South of the harbor, Tautog launched two torpedoes at Goyo Maru, scoring one hit and suffering a circular run (typical of the erratic Mark XIV torpedo), forcing Tautog deep.[10] (Goyo Maru beached herself.)[11] Two days later, Tautog was alerted by ULTRA of four Japanese submarines in the vicinity, also returning from battle.[10] She was caught by surprise by the first, and failed to attack.[10] She detected and fired two torpeodes at the second.
One of the most successful submarines of World War II, Tautog was credited with sinking 26 Japanese ships,[5] for a total of 72,606 tons, scoring first by number of ships and eleventh by tonnage[6] earning her the nickname "The Terrible T."
While she was attempting this, another ship came over the horizon to rescue survivors.[25] Leaving the bait sitting, Tautog dived and began a submerged approach, firing a spread of three torpedoes; cargo ship Shojen Maru sank, more quickly than her inexplicably durable sister.[25] As the sub headed homeward on the night of 16 March, Tautog made radar contact on a convoy of seven ships off Hokkaidō.
With all torpedoes expended, Tautog tracked a convoy for two days while radioing its position back to Pearl Harbor before she returned to Midway Island on 18 November. Ninth patrol[edit]
12 Tenth patrol 13 Eleventh patrol
The next day, Tautog made radar contact with a ship and tracked the target while working toward a good firing position.
The Japanese then launched a boat, were given water, and directed to the nearest land.
Following an overhaul at San Francisco, California, Tautog resumed operations from Pearl Harbor in October 1943, sinking Submarine Chaser # 30 and damaging a tanker and three freighters during this cruise, her eighth of the war.
14 Twelfth patrol 15 Thirteenth patrol 16 Fate
Tautog's assignment for her tenth war patrol took her to the cold waters of the northern Pacific near the Kuril Islands, from Paramushiro south to the main islands of Japan and the northeast coast of Hokkaidō.
19 External links Construction[edit]
She returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit by Bushnell (AS-15) on 30 January, credited with two ships for 9,700 tons (postwar, 6,000).[29] Tenth patrol[edit]
She was credited with one ship of 5,100 tons; postwar, it was reduced to 4,000 tons.[18]
When Tautog opened fire to sink the ship, several more Japanese emerged and scrambled into the boat. Ten more rounds left the schooner a burning hulk.
When Tautog last saw Fushimi Maru (5,000 tons)[31] through the fog, her bow was in the air.
Her next four patrols, in December 1943 - August 1944, took her to the Japanese home islands, including the chilly northern Pacific.
Her keel was laid down on 1 March 1939 at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company.
Escorts forced Tautog deep and depth charged her for seven hours without doing any damage.
One hit, slowed the target, and two more torpedoes left Miyazaki Maru (4,000 tons)[31] sinking by the stern.
Tautog was placed out of service and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 September 1959. On 15 November 1959, she was sold to the Bultema Dock and Dredge Company of Manistee, Michigan, for scrap.
Sixth patrol[edit] Isonami, sunk by Tautog 9 April 1943.
One hit obscured the target.
She was credited with six ships sunk for 19,500 tons; postwar, this was reduced to three for 7,500 tons.[14]
A lone survivor, taken on board the submarine, identified the ship as Matsu Maru which was transporting a load of lumber from Tokyo to Muroran.
Fate[edit] Plans to use Tautog as a target during atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946 were cancelled, and she was assigned to the Ninth Naval District on 9 May 1947 as a reserve training ship.
The first torpedo scored a hit 20 seconds after being fired and a yellowish-green flash went up amidships of Shinei Maru as she went down.
On 17 March, she sighted a grounded tanker with topside damage from an air attack.
Five explosions close aboard caused extensive minor damage. The submarine returned to Fremantle ten days later for repair and refit.
Again loaded with mines, the submarine put to sea 8 October 1942.
After watching the first one explode against the nearer ship, Tautog was forced deep by an escort, but heard two timed explosions and breaking-up noises accompanied by more explosions.
After he had examined the ship's papers, Tautog's commanding officer allowed the vessel to resume its voyage.
The next month she sank a landing ship and a motor torpedo boat tender to conclude an extraordinary combat career.
She maneuvered into position off the enemy's starboard flank so that two ships were almost overlapping and launched four torpedoes.
Plagued by a fogging periscope, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 4 February and was routed to Mare Island for upkeep.
The stranger broke the Japanese colors and hoisted a signal flag. Investigation revealed a Japanese crew and four Filipinos on board.
Thirteenth patrol[edit]
Assigned to training duty in February 1945, Tautog spent the rest of World War II in that role and supporting developmental work off Hawaii and the West Coast.
Tautog was later credited with inflicting medium damage to Kogyo Maru.
A Japanese destroyer closed the submarine, forced her deep, and subjected her to a depth charge attack for one and one-half hours.
Seventh patrol[edit]
When last seen, the cargoman's bow and stern were both in the air.
Tautog sank the 4,474-ton cargo ship Meiten Maru on 20 June, prior to ending her 53-day patrol at Pearl Harbor.
The submarine was briefly attacked by escorts but evaded them and set her course for Midway.
She returned to Midway on 23 March.
Tautog returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 December 1941.
In 1947 Tautog went to the Great Lakes, where she was employed as a stationary Naval Reserve training submarine at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for nearly twelve years.
She reached San Diego on 9 April and operated in conjunction with the University of California's Department of War Research in experimenting with new equipment which it had developed to improve submarine safety.

At dawn on 9 May, she fired on another freighter, missing.[31] Three days later, the submarine fired her last three torpedoes[31] at Banei Maru Number 2 (1,100 tons)[31] and watched her disappear in a cloud of smoke.
When the air cleared, the cargo ship Konei Maru had sunk.
Within minutes of the first enemy bomb explosions on Ford Island, Tautog's gun crews went into action and, with the help of Narwhal (SS-167) and a destroyer, shot down a Japanese torpedo bomber as it came over Merry Point.
That night, Tautog was headed for Alors Strait when she sighted a ship (thought to be a freighter) coming west, accompanied by an escort.
Following brief training in Long Island Sound, Tautog got underway for the Caribbean Sea on her shakedown cruise which lasted from 6 September 1940 to 11 November 1940.
Tautog made a sharp turn and fired one stern torpedo, evidently exploding above the target,[7] which sank Ro-30 (1,000 tons).[8]
Tautog's first patrol, into the Marshall Islands in late 1941 and early 1942, produced reconnaissance information but no sinkings.
During her next patrol, from 17 April to 21 May 1944, Tautog (handed over to Thomas S. Baskett, formerly of USS S-37 (SS-142)) returned to the Kuril Islands.
Despite five torpedo and four gun attacks, however, she only sank two confirmed ships for 7,000 tons (wartime, 6,800).[27]
Three minutes later, the submarine fired her first torpedo.
Tautog was refitted by Holland (AS-3) at Albany, south of Fremantle.
USS Tautog was removed from service in September 1959.
Twelfth patrol[edit]
This period was a very productive one, with the destroyer Shirakumo and eleven Marus falling victim to Tautog's torpedoes.
10 Eighth patrol 11 Ninth patrol
However, on her second visit to that area, in the spring of 1942, she torpedoed the Japanese submarines RO-30 and I-28, plus a freighter.
Although the Japanese boat was not in sight when Tautog surfaced, she was not officially credited with a sinking.
Operational history[edit]
Late in April, she returned to New London, Connecticut, loaded supplies, and sailed with two other submarines for Hawaii on 1 May.
At 09:43, her crew heard a loud explosion, and sonar reported the cruiser's screws had stopped.
Tautog then headed for Fremantle, where she was greeted warmly for her "extreme aggressiveness."[22] She was credited with two ships sunk for 6,900 tons; postwar, this was limited to two of 2,900.[23]
Escorts forced the submarine deep, but timed explosions indicated a hit on each ship.
One torpedo, well placed near the stern, produced a secondary explosion, and the ship settled by the stern.
She held refresher training when the yard work was completed and got underway for Hawaii.
Her orders were subsequently modified, and she got underway on 31 October for the East Coast. Tautog arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 18 November and was decommissioned on 8 December 1945.
In the next few minutes, as the cruiser got underway at reduced speed, Tautog scored two more hits, while the cruiser opened fire on her periscope with 5 in (127 mm) guns, preventing her from tracking the target for another attack; the cruiser limped into Ambon.[20]
She sank the 5,214-ton freighter Penang Maru with three torpedoes, then the destroyer Isonami (1,750 tons)[26] as it rescued crew from the Penang Maru with three more and missed with three.[25] During this patrol, in four battle surfaces to test her new gun (only the third 5"/25 cal pirated from an old V-boat,[25]) Tautog also sank a schooner, a sailboat, and a motor sampan.
The submarine topped off with fuel at Midway and entered her patrol area on 5 March 1944. Her only casualty of the war occurred that day.
A stateside overhaul followed, with the submarine's thirteenth war patrol, into the East China Sea, beginning in December 1944.

The American submarine pursued the remaining ships and attacked again from their starboard flank, firing three torpedoes at a medium-sized freighter and four at another ship.
The American submarine's crew thought they had sunk the target, but the 5,461-ton cargo ship Sanko Maru had been only damaged.
She contacted a freighter in Ombai Strait on 24 December and tracked her until 03:06 the next morning when she fired three stern tubes.
Her fifth war patrol, from 15 December 1942 to 30 January 1943, took Tautog (now in the hands of William B.
The targets suddenly turned toward Tautog and were recognized as an antisubmarine warfare team. The submarine went deep but still received a severe pounding.
On 3 January 1944, Tautog tracked a cargo ship off the mouth of the Kumano Kawa River, approximately one-half mile from the seawall.
Tautog went deep and began retiring westward; enemy patrol boats kept her down for ten hours before they withdrew.
Quickly submerging, the submarine determined that the ship was a 75-ton fishing schooner. Tautog prepared for battle, surfaced, closed the range, and fired a shot from her deck gun across the schooner's bow; the target hove to.
Operating out of Australia between July 1942 and May 1943, Tautog went into the waters of the East Indies and Indochina on five patrols that cost the enemy the destroyer Isonami and seven merchantmen.
The hunting was poor, and she sank only one ship, Ohio Maru (5,900 tons),[15] on 6 August.
It missed and alerted an escort which gave Tautog a severe depth charge attack.
Tautog operated in the Hawaiian area until mid-October.
However, she never learned the results of these attacks since enemy escorts forced her to go deep and kept her down for four hours while they rained 99 depth charges on her.
On 23 June 1944, Tautog departed Pearl Harbor for Japanese waters to patrol the east coasts of Honshū and Hokkaidō.

C++ (pronounced cee plus plus) is a general purpose programming language.
For many years, different C++ compilers implemented the C++ language to different levels of compliance to the standard, and their implementations varied widely in some areas such as partial template specialization.

When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing.
History Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++
It is designed with a bias for systems programming (e.g. embedded systems, operating system kernels), with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design requirements.
Objects known to be of a certain specific type can also be cast to that type with static_cast, a purely compile-time construct that has no runtime overhead and does not require RTTI.
The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their formal parameters.
Dynamic polymorphism Inheritance
See also: Template metaprogramming and Generic programming C++ templates enable generic programming.
No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations that have been explicitly asked for by the programmer). Make user created types have equal support and performance to built in types.
As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual.
Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion.
With the use of a library, garbage collection is possible.
Philosophy Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been informally governed by a set of rules that its evolution should follow:[5] It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be useful immediately in real world programmes. Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).
A large part of the C++ library is based on the STL.
 "typeid" operator typeid
Any features that you do not use you do not pay for (e.g. in performance).
In 1998, it standardized C++ for the first time as ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (informally known as C++98).
int main()
A small extension to C++11, C++14 ( also known as C++1y) featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements is planned for release in 2014.[19] It holds similar aims as C++03 did to C++98.
As the C++ language evolved, the standard library evolved with it.
In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published.
In 1983, it was renamed from C with Classes to C++ (++ being the increment operator in C).
The final name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983)[7] and was first used in December 1983.
Later, among the most significant additions to the standard library, was a large amount of the Standard Template Library.
It should provide facilities for organising programmes into well defined separate parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.
There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language). C++ should work alongside other pre-existing programming languages, rather than being part of its own separate and incompatible programming environment.
An automatic variable is simply declared with its class name, and storage is allocated on the stack when the value is assigned.
The fine control over memory management is similar to C, but in contrast with languages that intend to hide such details from the programmer, such as Java, Perl, PHP, and Ruby. Templates
 "sizeof" operator sizeof
Main article: C++ classes
The Boehm garbage collector is commonly used for this purpose.
dot operator . Member selection operator .*
Objects cannot be created from abstract data types; they can only be derived from.
The current standard (C++11) supersedes these, with new features and an enlarged standard library.
While not an official part of the standard, it specified a number of extensions to the standard library, which were then included in the next version of C++ (then C++0x).
So far it has seen three versions of C++ released and is currently working on releasing C++1y.

Dynamic memory allocation.
Static polymorphism
Before standardization (1989 onwards), C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs, starting in 1979, who wanted an efficient flexible language (like C) that also provided high level features for programme organization.[5]
C++ is standardized by an ISO working group, JTC1/SC22/WG21.
C++ supports both function and class templates.
cinttypes (inttypes.h). To intermix C and C++ code, any function declaration or definition that is to be called from/used both in C and C++ must be declared with C linkage by placing it within an extern "C" {/*...*/} block. Such a function may not rely on features depending on name mangling (i.e., function overloading).
The first addition to the C++ standard library was the stream I/O library which provided facilities to replace the traditional C functions such as printf and scanf.
The latest major revision of the C++ standard, C++11 (formerly known as C++0x), was approved and released on the 12 August 2011,[17] as 14882:2011.[18]
After C++1y, a major revision, informally known as C++17, is planned for 2017.[19]
If what the programmer wants to do is unknown, allow the programmer to specify (provide manual control). Standardization
C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, SQL) , performance critical applications (e.g. telephone switches, space probes) and entertainment software, such as video games.[3]
The following is Bjarne Stroustrup's version of the Hello world program that uses the C++ Standard Library stream facility to write a message to standard output:[20][21]
At first, the class, derived class, strong typing, inlining, and default argument features were added to C via Stroustrup's "C with Classes" to C compiler, Cpre.[7]
Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish and British trained computer scientist, began his work on C++'s predecessor "C with Classes" in 1979.[6] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis.
A joke goes that the name itself has a bug: due to the use of post-increment, which increments the value of the variable but evaluates to the unincremented value, C++ is no better than C, and the pre-increment ++C form should have been used instead.[12]
int i{vec.at(4)}; }
catch(std::exception& e) {
In addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual.
Language C++ inherits most of C's syntax.
Exception handling
Besides C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced C++, for example, ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
Overloaded "&&" and "||" operators lose their short-circuit evaluation property.
Exception handling is a mechanism in C++ that is used to handle errors in a uniform manner and separately from the main body of a programme's source code.
In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols.

For example, a "Flying Cat" class can inherit from both "Cat" and "Flying Mammal".
A general rule of thumb is that if any functions in the class are virtual, the destructor should be as well.
Inheritance from a base class may be declared as public, protected, or private.
It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low level memory manipulation.
Operator Symbol Scope resolution operator :: Conditional operator ?:
Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#,[2] Java and newer versions of C (after 1998).
Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.[5] C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used.
Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development.
This work became the basis for the future standard.
Polymorphism See also: Polymorphism in object-oriented programming
Templates are a tool for static polymorphism (see below) and generic programming.
Various organizations provide them, including the FSF, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel.
It is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms.
In 2003 it then published a new version of the C++ standard, ISO/IEC 14882:2003, which fixed problems which had been identified in C++98.

The 5th arrondissement contains the Quartier Latin (also spanning the 6th), a 12th-century scholastic centre formerly stretching between the left bank's Place Maubert and the Sorbonne campus of the University of Paris, its oldest and most famous college.[140] It is known for its lively atmosphere and many bistros.
Centuries of cultural and political development have brought Paris a variety of museums, theatres, monuments and architectural styles.
Also of note is Musée de l'Éventail, Hôpital Saint-Louis, The Kurdish Digital Library, Lariboisière Hospital, Lycée Edgar-Poe, Prison Saint-Lazare and the Saint Laurent and Saint-Vincent-de-Paul churches.[151] The Alhambra music hall opened in 2008.

About one third of persons who have recently moved to Metropolitan France from foreign countries settle in the Paris Region, about a third of whom in the city of Paris proper.[112] 20% of the Paris population are first-generation international immigrants, and 40% of children have at least one immigrant parent.
The 11th arrondissement is located in the east, west of the 20th arrondissement.
11 Education
12 Libraries 13 Media
The 12th arrondissement in the south-eastern suburbs of Paris is separated from the 13th by the Seine with several bridges.
Recent immigrants tend to be more diverse in terms of qualification: more of them have no qualification at all and more or them have tertiary education.[112]
They also created four large new parks around the city, including the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes.
The 13th and 14th arrondissements lie in the southern suburbs of Paris.
The 13th, to the south-east contains the neighbourhoods of Chinatown, Floral City, Butte-aux-Cailles, and the Italie 2 shopping centre with some 130 stores.[155] Institutions such as the Bibliothèque nationale de France and École Estienne are located here.

Paris and its metropolitan area is one of the most multi-cultural in Europe: at the 2010 census, 23.0% of the total population in the Paris Region was born outside of Metropolitan France, up from 19.7% at the 1999 census.[111]
Though international migration rate is positive, population flows from the rest of France are more intense, and negative.
They are heavily age dependent: while many retired people leave Paris for the Southern and Western parts of France, migration flows are positive in the 18-30 age range.[113] About one half of Île-de-France population was not born in the region.
In the 14th is Montparnasse a historic left bank area famous for artists' studios, music halls, and café life.[156] The Montparnasse Cemetery, large Montparnasse – Bienvenüe Métro station, Théâtre Montparnasse, and the lone Tour Montparnasse skyscraper are located there.
Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Paris

It contains the squares Place de la Nation, Place de la République, Place du 8 Février 1962, the theatres Bataclan, Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques, Théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique, Théâtre des Délassements-Comiques, and Théâtre des Funambules, the museums Musée du Fumeur and Musée Édith Piaf,[152] and La Roquette Prisons. Opéra Bastille
The Invalides museum is the burial place for many great French soldiers, including Napoleon, and the 18th-century military school, Ecole Militaire, is also located here.[146]
The 15th arrondissement, located in the south-western part of the city, is the most populous arrondissement.
In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi).[75] The metropolitan area of the city is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).[76]
La Défense, the largest dedicated business district in Europe.[114]

It is has several bridges, such as Pont du Garigliano and Pont Mirabeau.
The Paris Region is France's premier centre of economic activity, and with a 2011 GDP of €607 billion[115] (US$845 billion), it is not only the wealthiest area of France, but has one of the highest GDPs in the world, after Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, Seoul and London[116] making it an engine of the global economy.
The Parisian economy has been gradually shifting towards high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services, etc.) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.).
Paris Saint-Germain F.C. against Borussia Dortmund at the Parc des Princes
However, in the 2009 European Green City Index, Paris was still listed as the second most "green" large city in Europe, after Berlin.[121] The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine département and suburban La Défense business district places Paris's economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the Opéra Garnier, La Défense and the Val de Seine.
While the Paris economy is largely dominated by services, it remains an important manufacturing powerhouse of Europe, especially in industrial sectors such as automobiles, aeronautics, and electronics.
There are also many business schools, including INSEAD, ESSEC, HEC and ESCP Europe.

Going into the Brazilian Grand Prix, Kovalainen qualified fifth on the grid, leading many to believe that the McLarens were fuelled heavier than the other frontrunners, having set the pace earlier in the weekend.[36][37][38] Kovalainen eventually finished seventh.
Kovalainen's car was almost completely buried under the tyres.
Formula Three (2002)

Kovalainen and Petrov were dropped in favour of Charles Pic and Giedo van der Garde ahead of the 2013 season, but Kovalainen remained on good terms with Caterham, attending the Malaysian Grand Prix as a personal guest of Tony Fernandes.[43] Ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the team announced that it had re-signed Kovalainen as one of its reserve drivers, replacing Ma Qing Hua and alongside Alexander Rossi, in which role he will take part in the first free practice sessions in Bahrain and Spain.[44]
Driving for the Arden International team, Kovalainen began the season with strong results by winning the first round of the championship in Imola and then finishing third in the sprint race.
His season got off to a rough start; he made several mistakes during the race, finishing tenth.
Renault signed him on as a full-time Formula One test driver for 2006, and then promoted him to a race seat for 2007.
Lotus (2013)
Born in Suomussalmi, Finland, Kovalainen's career began in kart racing, much like that of many other Formula One drivers.
In the race Kovalainen developed brake temperature problems, however, and could not match Vettel's pace, finishing in second place, but was disappointed at the lost chance for a win.[29]
In Malaysia he was penalised five places for blocking Nick Heidfeld's BMW Sauber in the latter stages of qualifying, dropping to eighth.
He also drove for Lotus F1 for the final two races of 2013.
In 2007, Kovalainen and Grönholm again made the Nations Cup final, where they lost to the German team of Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel.
He also participated in the Nations Cup alongside countryman Marcus Grönholm, but they finished in second place after Kovalainen's Ferrari 360 Modena broke down in the finals, losing to the French team of Loeb and Alesi.
He was then taken by helicopter to a Barcelona area hospital for further tests.
The Safety Car was deployed for six laps as the debris was removed, and he was finally removed from the car and placed on a stretcher, at which point he gave a "thumbs-up".
Kovalainen continued in the series in 2004, but moved to Pons Racing, where he won the championship ahead of Tiago Monteiro, with 192points and six wins.[1] With Kimi Räikkönen finishing seventh in Formula One and Marcus Grönholm fifth in the World Rally Championship, Kovalainen was awarded as the Finnish Driver of the Year.
He reported the understeer on the radio, and during his first pit stop the mechanics tried to improve the situation by raising the front-wing angle.
Kovalainen competed in the 2004 Race of Champions at the Stade de France in Paris.
At the Chinese Grand Prix on his 27th birthday, he qualified in fifth position despite leading the timesheets in the initial part of third qualifying.[32] In the race, Kovalainen's first set of front tyres had been marked incorrectly, so the left tyre was installed on the right-hand side of the car and vice versa, meaning the tyres were spinning in the wrong direction, causing understeer.
The second half of the European season failed to produce equally strong results, but it did keep the points tally ticking over.
Kovalainen's apprenticeship in the junior categories of motor sport was more conventional, but he used Renault power at every step along the way.[1] He finished fourth in the championship with two wins, two pole positions, five podiums and three fastest laps, earning the Rookie of the Year award.
The cause of the accident was later determined to have been a production error on the wheel rim.[11][12][13]
Kovalainen scored his first World Championship point in his second Grand Prix at Sepang, Malaysia, and followed this with a ninth place in Bahrain.
At the end of the 2007 season Fernando Alonso returned to Renault, and Kovalainen was left with offers from Toyota and McLaren.[4][5] On 14 December 2007 it was confirmed that Kovalainen would replace Alonso once again and drive for McLaren Mercedes in 2008, alongside Lewis Hamilton.[6][7] Kovalainen joined Keke Rosberg, Mika Häkkinen and Kimi Räikkönen as Finnish drivers that have driven for McLaren.
He also finished on the lead lap, in 18th place at the Japanese Grand Prix, and finished ahead of the Saubers of Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez in Korea, in 14th place.
In Bahrain he flatspotted a tyre on the first lap and was consequently well off the pace of the Ferraris and the BMW Saubers.[8] Towards the end he improved and recorded the fastest lap of the race again, coming home fifth.
Hamilton turns the car in a shorter time whereas Kovalainen is trying to make the corners more round, inadvertently causing more wear on the tyres.
Better was to come at the Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway, where, despite not making it through to the final qualifying session, Kovalainen raced well.
Seventh place at the British Grand Prix was no disaster, with Fisichella finishing behind him.
Kovalainen finished 16th in Canada, 2 laps down.
In Malaysia, Kovalainen retired with 10 laps to go, and followed this up with fourteenth in China, while in Spain Kovalainen failed to start with gearbox problems.
He finished 14th in Monaco and 19th at the European Grand Prix, with further retirements in Canada and Great Britain.
During the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours, he was battling with Fisichella until the sharp Adelaide hairpin, when Jarno Trulli's Toyota made an optimistic lunge up the inside of Kovalainen which wrecked both drivers' races.
After finishing ninth in the Chinese Grand Prix, Kovalainen made a mistake in qualifying in Brazil and was left 17th on the grid.
During the season, Kovalainen outqualified team-mates Trulli and Karun Chandhok in 17 out of the 19 races held, and Team Lotus principal Tony Fernandes stated that he was satisfied with Kovalainen's performance over the season.[42]
McLaren (2008–2009)
He then beat World Rally Champion Sébastien Loeb in the finals using the Ferrari and a Peugeot 307 WRC car, although Kovalainen had never even sat in a rally car before, to become the first non-rally driver to win the Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy and earn the title "Champion of Champions".
In Belgium he qualified third, but lost eight places at the start.[28] On lap ten he collided with Mark Webber and was given a drive-through penalty, which dropped him to fifteenth place.
Kovalainen at the Monaco Grand Prix.
He crashed at the first chicane in qualifying, and damaged his rear wing significantly, and failed to make it through to the second qualifying session.
Kovalainen was pulling away from the Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen in the closing stages, which was a real confidence booster for the team.
He retired in Monaco with steering problems, and in Turkey with hydraulic problems.
Since the McLaren was harder on the tyres than the Renault and the Bridgestones were not quite as robust as the Michelins, that driving style now led to excessive tyre degradation.[30] In Japan Kovalainen qualified third behind Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen.
On lap 36 he felt a vibration at the left rear, and suddenly the back end of the car snapped, launching Kovalainen into the barriers.
During the initial tussle between Hamilton and Räikkönen, Kovalainen was pushed off the track along with several other cars.
Kovalainen remained with Lotus in 2011.

He worked his way back up to seventh, but on the final lap had to retire due to a gearbox failure, which left him outside the points.
He held Räikkönen off, and led the race at the end of his first stint when the cars ahead of him made their pit stops.
Kovalainen moved into the Renault-owned World Series by Nissan in 2003 – but faced a tough team-mate at the Gabord team in Franck Montagny.
He explained his driving style was now very close to Hamilton's, as well as his car set-up.
The team took a gamble in the next race at Spa-Francorchamps, with Kovalainen on a one-stop strategy while his challengers for the rear end of the points were all on two-stop strategies, which included the BMW's of Heidfeld and Kubica (who was docked ten places down the grid due to an engine change), Nico Rosberg and Mark Webber.
Hamilton hits the brakes harder and turns the car more quickly into the corner, while Kovalainen's softer driving style would be to drive with a longer curve into the corner, going easier on the brakes and accelerating halfway through the corner.
In the week leading up to the Hungarian Grand Prix, McLaren confirmed that Kovalainen would remain with the team for 2009.[23] He won his first race at Hungary and became the 100th driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix after race leader Felipe Massa retired due to an engine failure with three laps remaining.[24] After the race Kovalainen commented: "In previous races my driving was too hard on the tyres.
In September Kovalainen elaborated on the tyre issues for Autosport.
Kovalainen was running in third when on lap 17 his car suffered an engine failure.[31]

Kovalainen was promoted in Montagny's place at the end of 2005 and spent the 2006 season in a full-time testing role, logging over 28,000 km of testing.
Kovalainen at the 2007 British Grand Prix
The car was off the pace in pre-season testing, due to a lack of downforce caused by the need for a conservative initial design.[41] Kovalainen finished in fifteenth position in the race, two laps down on winner Fernando Alonso.
Retiring from the last sprint race, Kovalainen finished runner-up in the series, 15 points adrift.[1]
After his first official testing session occurred on 9 January 2008 at Jerez, Kovalainen made his McLaren race début at the Australian Grand Prix, where he was quickest in the first qualifying session and started third on the grid behind Lewis Hamilton and Robert Kubica.

In Barcelona he scored his third consecutive podium, but in the sprint race his car stalled on the grid.
In the final two rounds in Bahrain, Rosberg and ART seemed to be unmatched again, and he secured the championship by winning the feature race with Kovalainen finishing third.
Kovalainen scored a point at both the Nürburgring and the Hungaroring, and scored three more in Turkey, with Kovalainen coming ahead of Robert Kubica.
In the sprint race he could only manage fifth position, however, and this meant that with four races left in the season, Kovalainen was leading Rosberg by only four points.
He had luck with the strategy and the Safety Car, and a podium was within his grasp, but he could not find a way past Alexander Wurz of Williams, who had also started towards the rear of the pack.
Kovalainen and Arden fought back, scoring podiums and points positions in Silverstone, Hockenheim and Hungaroring, but were unable to find the necessary speed to beat Rosberg.
At Magny-Cours he won again from fourth on the grid, and came third in the sprint race.
He returned to the Race of Champions in 2005, defeating Bernd Schneider and Felipe Massa, but was then knocked out in the semi-finals by Tom Kristensen.[1] Kovalainen won the Nations Cup with Grönholm in 2006, but was eliminated in the individual event at the semi-final stage by Mattias Ekström by a mere 0.0002 seconds.

At the Nürburgring he gave his best performance yet, by winning the race from 17th on the grid.
Formula Renault (2001)
In Australia, Trulli did not start the race and Kovalainen finished 13th.
In Singapore, Kovalainen qualified fifth, and tried to overtake Kubica for fourth place at the start of the race, but they made contact at Turn 3, causing Kovalainen to lose two places to Glock and Vettel.
The problem seemed to be indeed caused by his different driving style compared to Hamilton, particularly the way he enters corners, uses brakes differently and then accelerates.
A good start from Kovalainen saw him become a mobile chicane for all of them except Webber.
His final condition was a minor concussion, whilst also complaining of a sore elbow and neck.[9] Kovalainen apparently did not lose consciousness at any point, according to the people who assisted him at the scene, but he himself had no memory of the accident nor of giving the "thumbs-up".
Problems during his pitstop, however, dropped him down to fifth.

On the doors of the storage areas inscriptions were placed at the entry doors telling the who built the storage area and the quantity of the items placed in them.
The team was led by Konstantine Hovhannisyan and Boris Piotrovsky, who served as an on-site adviser.[17] In the course of the early stage of the excavations (1950–1968), Argishti's palace, the royal assembly hall, temples and over a hundred rooms were excavated.
Exterior walls of Erebuni
Architecture[edit]
The temple had a large oblong plan with a staircase that led to the roof of a ziggurat type tower and a side room on the lower floor.
Numerous cuneiform inscriptions carved on basalt have been found around the complex.
Buni comes from the Nakh root which spawned the Chechen word bun meaning shelter or cabin; the root however simply means lair or shelter.
Smaller ceramic vessels were also found in excavations and are known to have been used in brewing beer made from barley.
An altar for sacrifices was located at the left wall.
Other much larger vessels were used for storing foods and wine.
The walls were decorated with colorful frescoes depicting representations of human figures, gods, geometric and floral designs.
It also overlooked cramped Urartian town made up of residences below at the foot of the hill.

785–753 BC) in 782 BC.
Jaimoukha states furthermore that the name of the Èr also serves as the root for the Arax valley (the Erashki gorge) and for the Medieval Georgian name used in the Georgian Chronicles for Lake Sevan- "Lake Ereta".
The Circassian historian Amjad Jaimoukha gives an alternative etymology,[3] however: eri (referring to the Èrs, the people living in the area) + buni.
As an unchanging direct object, scholars have conjectured that the word may also mean "to take" or "to capture" and thus believe that the Erebuni at the time of its founding meant "capture", "conquest", or "victory."[2]
The strategic position that Erebuni occupied did not diminish, however, becoming an important center of the satrapy of Armenia.[10][15]
In the autumn of 1950, an archaeological expedition led by Konstantine Hovhannisyan discovered an inscription at Arin Berd dedicated to the city's founding which was carved during Argishti's reign.
The region soon fell under the control of the Achaemenian Empire.
The enormous ceramic jars that held the wine and oil had markings upon them.
The floor of the temple contrasted greatly from the rest of the complex in that it had wood floors composed of small planks, compared to the clay-coated adobe floors that were faced with stone slabs found in the rest of the citadel's rooms.
Van as a root is also present in numerous other placenames in historical Armenia, including the city Van, Lake Sevan, and Nakhichevan, so it is probable that the van in Yerevan is another direct translation of the root.
Successive Urartian kings made Erebuni their place of residence during their military campaigns against northern invaders and continued construction work to build up the fortress defences.[13] Kings Sarduri II and Rusa I also utilized Erebuni as a staging site for new campaigns of conquest directed towards the north.[14] In the early sixth century the Urartian state, under constant foreign invasion, collapsed.
In 1968 the Erebuni Museum of History was established.
Despite numerous invasions by successive foreign powers, the city was never truly abandoned and was continually inhabited over the following centuries, eventually branching out to become the city of Yerevan.[14][16] Erebuni's close affinity to Yerevan was celebrated in a splendid festival held in September 1968, commemorating Erebuni's 2,750th birthday.[10]
By the greatness of Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, is a mighty king, king of Biainili, and ruler of Tushpa."[9]
Argishti left a similar inscription at the Urartian capital of Tushpa (current-day Van) as well, stating that he brought 6,600 prisoners of war from Khate and Tsupani to populate his new city.[10] Similar to other Urartian cities of the time, it was built on a triangular plan on top of a hill and ensconced by 10-12 meter high ramparts.
By the greatness of god Chaldis, Sarduri, son of Argistis, built this house, and he also created these granaries.
History[edit]
Two other identical inscriptions have been found at the citadel of Erebuni.
On an inscription found at Karmir Blur, the verb erebu-ni is used in the sense of "to seize, pillage, steal, or kidnap" followed by a changing direct object.
Erebuni was founded by Urartian King Argishti I (r. ca.
By the greatness of the God Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty stronghold and proclaimed it Erebuni for the glory of Biainili (Urartu) and to instill fear among the king's enemies.
It led to the central yard of the citadel.
Erebuni Fortress (Armenian: Էրեբունի), also known as Arin Berd (Armenian: Արին Բերդ; meaning the "Fortress of Blood") is a fortified city from the ancient kingdom of Urartu, located in what is present-day Yerevan, Armenia.
Some of which are currently displayed in the museum, while others can still be found displayed on the walls.
Argishti says: The land was a desert, before the great works I accomplished upon it.
The inscription reads:

Dozens of Urartian and Achaemenian artifacts, such as pottery, earthenware, belt-buckles, bracelets, beads, drinking vessels, helmets, arrows and silver coins, were also uncovered.[17] The fragments of murals that were uncovered were found to be decorated with important religious themes, including "processions of gods, sacred animals, and trees of life", as well as scenes of everyday life, displaying scenes of "hunting, cattle breeding, and agriculture."[18]
One such inscription reads:
Early excavations began during the 19th century while more systematic excavations were carried out at Erebuni in 1952, under the joint sponsorship of the Armenian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography and the Pushkin Museum's Board for the Preservation and Restoration of Architectural Monuments.
The main entrance to the fortress was located at the more gently sloped southeastern site of the hill.
Storage areas for grain, oil, and wine were also uncovered.

Etymology[edit] See also: Yerevan
Cognates include Sanskrit भुवन (bhúvana, "world"), Albanian bun ("shepherd's hut") and Middle Persian بن bun ("bottom").[5] It may have spawned the word van in Armenian (a language with a strong Urartian substratum), albeit possibly through different roots (Urartian biani rather than Èr buni) which similarly means shelter.
Surrounding the hall was a double-rowed twelve-column open portico with benches along the walls.
The museum houses items uncovered during the excavations at Arin Berd and Karmir Blur and gives a history of the site.

Accordingly, the prisoners he captured in these campaigns, both men and women, were used to help build his town.[8]
Behind them, the buildings were separated by central and inner walls.
The walls were built from a variety of materials, including basalt, tuff, wood and adobe.[10] Argishti constructed a grand palace here and excavations conducted in the area have revealed that other notable buildings included a colonnaded royal assembly hall, a temple dedicated to Khaldi, a citadel, where the garrison resided, living quarters, dormitories and storerooms.[11] The inner walls were richly decorated with murals and other wall paintings, displaying religious and secular scenes.[12]
It is typical of other representations of Khaldi found at other sites.
With its Indo-European roots "bun" initially derives from the Armenian word buyn (բույն) for "birds nest" or "lair".[4] From Proto-Indo-European *bʰeuH-no-, from *bʰeuH- (“to be; to grow”).
Ceremonies held by the personal guards of Argishti I and guards of the fortress garrison were held here.
In the southwest portion of the yard was a temple of the god Khaldi.
It was built on top of a hill called Arin Berd overlooking the Arax River Valley to serve as a military stronghold to protect the kingdom's northern borders.[6] It has been described as being "designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital."[7] According to Margarit Israelyan, Argishti began the construction of Erebuni after conquering the territories north of Yerevan and west of Lake Sevan, roughly corresponding to where the town of Abovyan is currently located.
Small circular markings on the sides of these containers near the top indicated the amount that could be stored inside.
The name Yerevan itself is derived from Erebuni.[1]
Its opening was timed to coincide with the 2750th anniversary of Yerevan.
The larger of the vessels were usually buried half-way into the soil which naturally kept the contents cool.
In one of them there were 12,600 Kapis, another one had 11,500 Kapis; entirely 24,100 Kapis.
Interpreted in that way, the fortress would be the capital city of the Èr people.
One of the frescoes uncovered depicts the god Khaldi standing on a lion with a warder in his left hand and a horned crown upon his head.
The site of Erebuni Fortress was located atop the 65 m tall hill of Arin Berd as a strategic position overlooking the Ararat plain and the main roads leading to the citadel.
It was one of several fortresses built along the northern Urartian border and was one of the most important political, economic and cultural centers of the vast kingdom.

On 11 May 1904, the society formally accepted Horniman's offer of the use of the building.
During the 1940s and 1950s, the staple fare at the Abbey was comic farce set in the idealised peasant world of Éamon de Valera.[citation needed] If it had ever existed, it was no longer considered relevant by most Irish citizens.[citation needed] As a result, audience numbers continued to decline.

On 20 August 2005, the Abbey Theatre Advisory Council approved a plan to dissolve the Abbey's owner, the National Theatre Society, and replace it with a company limited by guarantee, the Abbey Theatre Limited.

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
The Abbey Theatre (Irish: Amharclann na Mainistreach), also known as the National Theatre of Ireland (Irish: Amharclann Náisiúnta na hÉireann), in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, first opened its doors to the public on 27 December 1904.
The Abbey reopened on 18 July 1966.[28] Recent years[edit]
Despite losing its original building to a fire in 1951, it has remained active to the present day.
They commissioned Yeats' brother Jack to paint portraits of all the leading figures in the society for the foyer, and hired Sarah Purser to design stained glass for the same space.[8]
The Abbey also developed a relationship with the Public Theater in New York, where it has presented two new plays; Terminus by Mark O'Rowe and Sam Shepard's Kicking a Dead Horse.
In addition, through its extensive programme of touring abroad and its high visibility to foreign, particularly American, audiences, it has become an important part of the Irish tourist industry.[1]
In 1909, Shaw's The Shewing-Up of Blanco Posnet led to further protests.
Frank O'Connor sat on the board from 1935 to 1939, served as managing director from 1937, and had two plays staged during this period.
They criticised Barnes for touring with a play in Australia during the deep financial and artistic crisis at home. Barnes returned and temporarily held his position.[29] The debacle put the Abbey under great public scrutiny.
Also that year, the proprietors decided to make the Abbey independent of Annie Horniman, who had indicated a preference for this course.
The performances played to a mainly working-class audience rather than the usual middle-class Dublin theatregoers.
She came to Dublin in 1903 to act as Yeats' unpaid secretary and to make costumes for a production of his play The King's Threshold.
On the second night, In the Shadow of the Glen by Synge replaced the second Yeats play. These two bills alternated over a five-night run.
In March 2007, the larger auditorium in the theatre was radically reconfigured by Jean-Guy Lecat as part of a major upgrade of the theatre.[33]
Theatregoers arose in riots over the last play, in a way reminiscent of those that had greeted the Playboy 19 years earlier.[18] Concerned about public reaction, the Abbey rejected O'Casey's next play.
Frank Fay, playing Cúchulainn in On Baile's Strand, was the first actor on the Abbey stage.[9] Although Horniman had designed the costumes, neither she nor Lady Gregory was present, as Horniman had already returned to England.
In addition to providing funding, her chief role with the Abbey over the coming years was to organise publicity and bookings for their touring productions in London and provincial England.
This trend was halted for a time by the emergence of Sean O'Casey as an heir to Synge.[17] O'Casey's career as a dramatist began with The Shadow of a Gunman, staged by the Abbey in 1923.
Early years[edit]
The Gate staged The Old Lady Says 'No' in The Peacock in 1928. (Note: academic critics Joseph Ronsley and Christine St. Peter have questioned the veracity of this story.)[24] After Yeats' withdrawal[edit]
Denis Johnston reportedly submitted his first play, Shadowdance, to the Abbey; however, Lady Gregory rejected it, returning it to the author with "The Old Lady says No" written across the title page.[23] Johnston decided to re-title the play.
At first, they staged performances in the Molesworth Hall.[6] When the Mechanics' Theatre in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available after fire safety authorities closed it, Horniman and William Fay agreed to buy and refit the space to meet the society's needs.[7]
On 17 July 1951, fire destroyed the Abbey Theatre, with only the Peacock surviving intact.[27] The company leased the old Queen's Theatre in September and continued in residence there until 1966.[2]
They chose not to stage Synge's next—and last completed—play, The Tinker's Wedding (1908), for fear of further disturbances.
As a mark of respect for the death of King Edward VII, an understanding existed that Dublin theatres were to close on the night of 7 May 1910.
Basing its actions on this plan, the Arts Council of Ireland awarded the Abbey €25.7 million in January 2006 to be spread over three years.[31] The grant represented an approximate 43 percent increase in the Abbey's revenues and was the largest grant ever awarded by the Arts Council.[32] The new company was established on 1 February 2006, with the announcement of a new Abbey Board chaired by High Court Judge Bryan McMahon.
Relations with Horniman had been tense, partly because she wished to be involved in choosing which plays were to be performed and when.
(November 2013) A new building; a new generation of dramatists, including such figures as Hugh Leonard, Brian Friel and Tom Murphy; and tourism that included the National Theatre as a key cultural attraction, helped revive the theatre.
On 12 May 2005, Barnes and managing director Brian Jackson resigned after it was found that the theatre's deficit of €1.85 million had been underestimated.[30] The new director, Fiach Mac Conghail, due to start in January 2006, took over in May 2005.[31]
In 2009, the Literary Department announced the pilot of a new development initiative, the New Playwrights Programme.
The new Abbey Theatre found great popular success, and large crowds attended many of its productions.
The run was a great success, thanks in part to Maud Gonne, who played the lead in Yeats' play.
The Abbey arose from three distinct bases, the first of which was the seminal Irish Literary Theatre.

After strong debate, the board accepted the program.
This was followed by Juno and the Paycock in 1924, and The Plough and the Stars in 1926.
After William returned to Dublin, the Fay brothers staged productions in halls around the city and eventually formed W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company, focused on the development of Irish acting talent.
On 27 December, the curtains went up on opening night.
Robinson, however, kept the Abbey open.[15] When Horniman heard of Robinson's decision, she severed her connections with the company.[16] By her own estimate, she had invested £10,350—worth approximately $1 million in 2007 US dollars—on the project.[citation needed]
They were joined by actors and playwrights from Fay's company.

The Abbey's fortunes worsened in January 1907 when the opening of Synge's The Playboy of the Western World resulted in civil disturbance.[2] The troubles (since known as the Playboy Riots) were encouraged, in part, by nationalists who believed the theatre was insufficiently political and who took offence at Synge's use of the word 'shift', as it was known at the time as a symbol representing Kitty O'Shea and adultery, and hence was seen as a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood.[13] Much of the crowd rioted loudly, and the actors performed the remainder of the play in dumbshow.[14] The theatre's decision to call in the police further roused anger of the nationalists.
On 3 September 1963, the President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, laid the foundation stone for the new theatre.
They held O'Connor's past adultery against him.
Although he fought formidably to retain his position, soon after Yeats died, the board began machinations to remove O'Connor.[25][26]
Contents [hide]
The company continued at the Antient Concert Rooms, producing works by Seumas O'Cuisin, Fred Ryan and Yeats.
Although press opinion soon turned against the rioters and the protests faded, management of the Abbey was shaken.
The Abbey was fortunate in having Synge as a key member, as he was then considered one of the foremost English-language dramatists.
Plays such as Brian Friel's Philadelphia Here I Come! (1964), The Faith Healer (1979) and Dancing at Lughnasa (1990); Tom Murphy's A Whistle in the Dark (1961) and The Gigli Concert (1983); and Hugh Leonard's Da (1973) and A Life (1980), helped raise the Abbey's international profile through successful runs in the West End in London, and on Broadway in New York City.
The latter was led by Ninette de Valois—who had provided choreography for a number of Yeats' plays—and ran until 1933.[21]
This drift might have been more dramatic but popular actors, including F. J. McCormick, and dramatists, including George Shiels, could still draw a crowd.[citation needed] Austin Clarke staged events for his Dublin Verse Speaking Society—later the Lyric Theatre—at the Peacock from 1941 to 1944 and the Abbey from 1944 to 1951.[citation needed]
With the loss of Horniman, Synge, and the Fays, the Abbey under Robinson tended to drift, suffering from falling public interest and box office returns.
The Abbey was the first state-subsidized theatre in the English-speaking world; from 1925 onwards it received an annual subsidy from the Irish Free State.

He emigrated to London shortly thereafter.[19]
This is illustrated by the story of how one new work was said to have come to the Gate Theatre.
Her money helped found the Abbey Theatre and, according to the critic Adrian Frazier, would "make the rich feel at home, and the poor—on a first visit—out of place."[5]
Beginning in 1957, the theatre's participation in the Dublin Theatre Festival aided its revival.
The tradition of the Abbey as primarily a writers' theatre survived Yeats' withdrawal from day-to-day involvement.
The third base was financial support and experience of Annie Horniman.[2] Horniman was a middle-class Englishwoman with previous experience of theatre production, having been involved in the presentation of George Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man in London in 1894.
In 1905 without properly consulting Horniman, Yeats, Lady Gregory and Synge decided to turn the theatre into a limited liability company, the National Theatre Society Ltd.[10] Annoyed by this treatment, Horniman hired Ben Iden Payne, a former Abbey employee, to help run a new repertory company which she founded in Manchester.[11] Leading actors Máire Nic Shiubhlaigh, Honor Lavelle (Helen Laird), Emma Vernon, Máire Garvey, Frank Walker, Seamus O'Sullivan, Pádraic Colum and George Roberts left the Abbey.[12]
The subsequent discussion occupied a full issue of the theatre's journal The Arrow.
World War I and the Irish Rebellion of 1916 almost ended the theatre; however in 1924, Yeats and Lady Gregory offered the Abbey to the government of the Free State as a gift to the Irish people.[2] Although the government refused, the following year Minister of Finance Ernest Blythe arranged an annual government subsidy of £850 for the Abbey.
In 1928, Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammoir launched the Gate Theatre, initially using the Peacock to stage works by European and American dramatists.[22] The Gate primarily sought work from new Irish playwrights and, despite the new space, the Abbey entered a period of artistic decline.[citation needed]
Since July 1966, the Abbey has been located at 26 Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1.
In September 2004 two members of the theatre's advisory council, playwrights Jimmy Murphy and Ulick O'Connor, had tabled a motion of no confidence in Artistic Director Ben Barnes.
Affiliated schools[edit] The Abbey School of Acting and The Abbey School of Ballet were set up that year.
In April 1902, the Fays gave three performances of Æ's play Deirdre and Yeats' Cathleen Ní Houlihan in a hall in St. Theresa's Hall on Clarendon Street.
In February 1961, the ruins of the Abbey were demolished. The board had plans for rebuilding with a design by the Irish architect Michael Scott.
The six writers taking part in this pilot programme were: Aidan Harney, Lisa Keogh, Shona McCarthy, Jody O'Neill, Neil Sharpson and Lisa Tierney-Keogh.[34]
As Horniman did not usually reside in Ireland, the royal letters patent required were granted in the name of Lady Gregory, although paid for by Horniman.
Encouraged by the St Theresa's Hall success, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Æ, Martyn, and John Millington Synge founded the Irish National Theatre Society in 1903 with funding from Horniman.
The Peacock and the Gate[edit] Around this time the company acquired additional space, allowing them to create a small experimental theatre, the Peacock, in the ground floor of the main theatre.
More than 30 writers have been commissioned by the Abbey since Mac Conghail was appointed director in May 2005.[35] The Abbey has recently produced new plays by Tom Murphy, Richard Dormer, Gary Duggan, Billy Roche, Bernard Farrell and Owen McCafferty.
That same year, the Fay brothers' association with the theatre ended when they emigrated to the United States due to a clash with Yeats outlook;[2] Lennox Robinson took over the Abbey's day-to-day management after Horniman withdrew financial support.[2]

The founders appointed William Fay theatre manager, responsible for training the actors in the newly established repertory company.
The second base involved the work of two Irish brothers, William and Frank Fay.[4] William worked in the 1890s with a touring company in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, while Frank was heavily involved in amateur dramatics in Dublin.
This made the company the first state-supported theatre in the English-speaking world.[20] The subsidy allowed the theatre to avoid bankruptcy, but the amount was too small to rescue it from financial difficulty.[citation needed]
The theatre staged many plays by eminent or soon-to-be eminent authors, including Yeats, Lady Gregory, Moore, Martyn, Padraic Colum, George Bernard Shaw, Oliver St John Gogarty, F. R. Higgins, Thomas MacDonagh, Lord Dunsany, T. C. Murray, James Cousins and Lennox Robinson. Many of these authors served on the board, and it was during this time that the Abbey gained its reputation as a writers' theatre.[citation needed]
The bill consisted of three one-act plays, On Baile's Strand and Cathleen Ní Houlihan by Yeats, and Spreading the News by Lady Gregory.
Foundation[edit]
Founded by Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and W.B.Yeats[2] in 1899—with assistance from George Moore—it presented plays in the Antient Concert Rooms and the Gaiety Theatre, which brought critical approval but limited public interest.[3]
He was alienated from and unable to cope with many of the other board members.

Zúñiga encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Ambrogio Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army, was sent at the head of the Army of Flanders to intervene.
Philip became increasingly mystical near the end of his life and died in 1665 hoping his last surviving son might somehow be more fortunate.
Emigration to the New World increased. France was now strong and united under Louis XIV, and after the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) took Spain's place as the dominant power in Europe.
The Spanish Army of Flanders, which represented the finest of Spanish soldiery and leadership, faced a French advance led by Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé in northern France at Rocroi in 1643.
The army in the Netherlands mutinied not long after, seizing Antwerp and looting the southern Netherlands, prompting several cities in the previously peaceful southern provinces to join the rebellion.
The Austrians, led by Charles's younger brother Ferdinand, continued to fight the Ottomans in the east.

The Aztec and Inca Empires were conquered during Charles' reign, from 1519 to 1521 and 1540 to 1558, respectively.
Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a barter economy as a result of the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry, depending instead on its colonies (Spanish treasure fleet).
Although Spain's territorial losses (the Franche-Comté, some towns in the Southern Netherlands and part of the island of Hispaniola) were relatively few, it had demonstrated its weakness, and Louis XIV (and indeed the other European rulers) had plans for when Charles II's death came, as it was clear that he would produce no children and the Habsburg line in Spain would die with him.
Spinola, a general of abilities to match Maurice, was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's renewed bankruptcy in 1607.

It was during this last decade when Castile began to suffer crop failures and was struck by a plague from 1596 that brought about the first serious reversal in population numbers; a cycle that would repeat itself a number of times in different parts of the country through the 17th century.[4]

The use of "notes of exchange" became common as Antwerp's banks became increasingly powerful and led to extensive speculation that helped to exaggerate price shifts.

El Greco and Velázquez were both painters, the former most notably recognized for his religious depictions and the latter—now regarded as one of the most important figures in all of Spanish art—for his precise, realistic portraiture of the contemporary court of Philip IV.
For Spain, the war was a creeping disaster.
Neither the New World silver or steadily increasing taxes were enough to cover the expenses of these wars, and the government went bankrupt again in 1596.
The more experienced Spanish forces scored initial successes; Olivares ordered a lightning campaign into northern France from the Spanish Netherlands, hoping to shatter the resolve of King Louis XIII's ministers and topple Richelieu before the war exhausted Spanish finances and France's military resources could be fully deployed.
The road to Rocroi (1626–1643)[edit]
In 1568, William the Silent led a failed attempt to drive the tyrannical Alva from the Netherlands. This attempt is generally considered to signal the start of the Eighty Years' War that ended with the independence of the United Provinces.
Like most of Europe, Spain had suffered from famine and plague during the 14th and 15th centuries.
In 1557, Spain met with bankruptcy and was forced to partially repudiate its debt through debt consolidation and conversion.[3]
Cervantes and de la Barca were both writers; Don Quixote de la Mancha, by Cervantes, is one of the most famous works of the period and probably the best-known piece of Spanish literature of all time.
Some of the outstanding figures of the period were El Greco, Diego Velázquez, Miguel de Cervantes, and Pedro Calderón de la Barca.
Ferdinand would die later that year.
Philip II greatly expanded the Inquisition and made church orthodoxy a goal of public policy.

But the government had gone bankrupt again in 1647 and 1653, and the nobility wouldn't give an inch on financial and tax reforms.
France was once again involved in her own instabilities (the famous Siege of La Rochelle began in 1627), and Spain's eminence seemed irrefutable.
France was stricken for the next thirty years by civil war and unrest (see French Wars of Religion) and was unable to effectively compete with Spain and the Habsburgs in the European power struggle.
This led to much debate and governmental action.
Charles I and Philip II were primarily concerned with their duties in Europe, and thus control of the Americas was handled by viceroys and colonial administrators who operated with virtual autonomy.
Gustav then marched south winning notable victories at Breitenfeld and Lutzen, attracting greater support for the Protestant cause the further he went.
The Habsburgs, whose family had traditionally ruled over diverse, noncontiguous domains and had been forced to devolve autonomy to local administrators, replicated those feudal policies in Spain, particularly in the Basque country and Aragon.
The Habsburg kings regarded their colonies as feudal associations rather than integral parts of Spain. No Spanish king could, or did, visit the colonies, either.
The Spanish Golden Age was a flourishing period of arts and letters in Spain which spanned roughly from 1550–1650.
The later Habsburgs did nothing to promote the redistribution of land. By the end of Charles II's reign, most of Castile was in the hands of a select few landowners, the largest of which by far was the Church. It has been estimated that at the end of the 17th century the holdings of the Spanish church had expanded to include nearly 20% of Castilian land and that the clergy made up as much as 10% of adult males in Castile.
Henry VIII of England, who bore a greater grudge against France than he held against the Emperor for standing in the way of his divorce, joined Charles in his invasion of France.
As the 16th century had worn on, inflation in Spain (a result of state debt and, more importantly, the importation of silver and gold from the New World) triggered hardship for the peasantry.
That son, Charles, was seriously deformed and mentally disabled due to continuous Habsburg intermarriage, and was manipulated by various political factions throughout his life.
Spain had invested itself in the religious warfare in France after Henry II's death.
The Spanish received a large but short lived influx of gold from the colonies in the New World as plunder when they were conquered, much of which Charles used to prosecute his wars in Europe.
The Spanish, led by Francisco de Melo, were routed.
In 1598, shortly before his death, Philip II, knowing his end was near, made peace with France, withdrawing his forces from French territory and stopping payments to the Catholic League after accepting the new convert to Catholicism, Henry IV, as the rightful French king.
Spain agreed to the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659 that ceded to France Artois, Roussillon, and portions of Lorraine.
The Spanish chose the route of negotiation, and pacified most of the southern provinces again with the Union of Arras in 1579. The Arras agreement required all Spanish troops to leave these lands.
The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of Antwerp, were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces.
Spanish victories in Germany and Italy were not enough to matter, and their navy especially began suffering serious losses.
The Spanish had been debasing their currency to pay for the war and prices exploded in Spain just as they had in previous years in Austria.
The Spanish, hard pressed elsewhere, were blamed for inadequately protecting Portugal's overseas colonies from the Dutch (who annexed part of Brazil), and in a time of economic downturn, the Spanish colonies did not enjoy having to trade and compete with their Portuguese counterparts.
The Spanish Empire had grown substantially since the days of Ferdinand and Isabella.
The Spanish armies in Germany resorted to "paying themselves" on the land.
Spanish settlements were established in the New World: Mexico City, the most important colonial city established in 1524 to be the primary center of administration in the New World; Florida, colonized in the 1560s; Buenos Aires, established in 1536; and New Granada (modern Colombia), colonized in the 1530s.
While reasonable when compared to the 20th century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called price revolution.
The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, the son of William the Silent and perhaps the greatest strategist of his time, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda.
The Dutch, who during the Twelve Years’ Truce had made their navy a priority, proceeded to plunder Spanish and (especially) Portuguese maritime trade, on which Spain was wholly dependent after the economic collapse.
Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit Order, was influential across the world in his stress on spiritual and mental excellence and contributed to a resurgence of learning across Europe.
Inflation - both in Spain and in the rest of Europe - was primarily caused by debt, but a level of debt made possible later by the rising silver imports; Charles had conducted most of his wars on credit, and in 1557, a year after he abdicated, Spain was forced into its first debt moratorium, setting a pattern that would be repeated with ever more disruptive economic consequences.
Main article: Spanish Golden Age
Under Charles I the Inquisition became a formal department in the Spanish government, hurtling out of control as the 16th century progressed.
By 1500, Europe was beginning to emerge from these demographic disasters, and populations began to explode.
As undisputed ruler in most of the Peninsula, Ferdinand adopted a more aggressive policy than he had as Isabella's husband, going on to crystallize his long-running designs over Navarre into a full-blown invasion led initially by a Castilian military expedition, and supported later by Aragonese troops (1512).
The church in Spain had been purged of many of its administrative excesses in the 15th century by Cardinal Ximenes, and the Inquisition served to expurgate many of the more radical reformers who sought to change church theology as the Protestant reformers wanted.
The destruction of the United Provinces of the Netherlands was added to his list of necessities because behind every anti-Habsburg coalition there was Dutch money: Dutch bankers stood behind the East India merchants of Seville, and everywhere in the world Dutch entrepreneurship and colonists undermined Spanish and Portuguese hegemony.
The revolt was only put down by Italian troops under Don John of Austria, and even then the Moriscos retreated to the highlands and were not defeated until 1570.
Most were incompetent and self-serving, but there were a few good men such as the Count of Oropesa, who managed (despite ruinous deflation) to stabilize the currency.
They clung to the absurd idea of placing the infanta Isabella on the English throne after Queen Elizabeth's death and sent a limited expeditionary force to Ireland to aid the Spanish-supplied rebels.
His mother Joanna remained titular queen of Castile until her death 1555, but due to her mental health and worries of her being proposed as an alternative monarch by opposition (as happened in the Revolt of the Comuneros), Charles kept her imprisoned.
His successor, Henry IV of France, the first Bourbon king of France, was a man of great ability, winning key victories against the Catholic League at Arques (1589) and Ivry (1590).
After 1590, the Spanish intervened directly in France, winning battles, but failing to prevent Henry of Navarre from becoming king as Henry IV.
Charles's involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic Habsburg cause in the Holy Roman Empire; the precedent would lead, seven decades later, to involvement in the war that decisively ended Spain's status as Europe's leading power.
Joanna of Castile
Cardinal Richelieu had been a strong supporter of the Dutch and Protestants since the beginning of the war, sending funds and equipment in an attempt to stem Habsburg strength in Europe.
Charles I and Philip II had been able to master the various courts through their impressive political energy, but the much weaker Philip III and IV allowed it to decay, and Charles II was incapable of controlling anything at all.
Charles and his successors, while they may have been most comfortable with and fond of Spain, regarded it as just another part of their empire, rather than nurturing and developing it, as France, England, and the Netherlands might have in their countries.
Although torture was common in Europe, the way the Inquisition was practiced encouraged corruption and betrayal, and it became a driving factor in the decay of Spanish power.
The Portuguese Revolt was partially what led Spain to conclude peace with France in 1659.
In response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch-Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority.
He first tried the path of negotiation at the Council of Trent in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the Council, went to war, led by the Saxon elector Maurice.
Charles had preferred to combat the Ottomans through a considerably more maritime strategy, hampering Ottoman landings on the Venetian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Charles, on becoming king, clashed with his nobles during the Castilian War of the Communities when he attempted to fill government positions with effective Dutch and Flemish officials.
Charles, through his position as Holy Roman Emperor, his important holdings along Germany's frontiers, and his close relationship with his Habsburg relatives in Austria, had a vested interest in maintaining the stability of the Holy Roman Empire.
An accusation, even if largely unfounded, led to a long and agonizing trial that might take years before coming to a verdict, during which time the accused's reputation and esteem was destroyed.
There was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed subdued.
Finally, the lives of the overburdened peasants were so miserable that they were unwilling to have children. The period 1677-1686 was the lowest point, with famine, plague, natural disasters, and economic chaos.
Moreover, Portugal's autonomous status as an equal in the union went into decline after Philip II and was treated increasingly in the great councils of state as a mere province.
He needed someone to do all his work for him, and he settled on the Duke of Lerma, an individual who was amiable but inept and due to Philip III's failure to carefully oversee matters of state, in the end corrupt.
Estates in Spain, and especially in Castile, grew progressively larger and the economy became increasingly uncompetitive, particularly during the reigns of Philip III and IV when repeated speculative crises shook Spain.
This period also saw a flourishing in intellectual activity, now known as the School of Salamanca, producing thinkers that were studied throughout Europe.
The city of Antwerp, in the Spanish Netherlands, lay at the heart of European commerce and its bankers financed most of Charles V's and Philip II's wars on credit.
Francis’s defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity.
The expulsion of the industrious Jews, Moors, and Moriscos certainly did nothing to help the Spanish economy.
Her husband Philip I was the Habsburg son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Mary of Burgundy.
The Count-Duke of Olivares, Philip IV's chief minister, always regarded it as essential to Spain's survival that the bureaucracy be centralized; Olivares even backed the full union of Portugal with Spain, though he never had an opportunity to realize his ideas.
Ferdinand's death led to the ascension of young Charles to the throne as Charles I of Castile and Aragon, effectively founding the monarchy of Spain.
With the Spanish Netherlands now very much on the defensive between French and Dutch forces after the Battle of Lens in 1648, the Spanish made peace with the Dutch and recognized the independent United Provinces in the Peace of Westphalia that ended both the Eighty Years' War and the Thirty Years' War.
Beginnings of the empire (1504–1521)[edit]
But Philip III and Lerma lacked the ability to make any meaningful change in the country's foreign policy.
The following year, Zúñiga was replaced by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, an able man who believed that the center of all Spain's woes rest in Holland.
England now entered the war and occupied Jamaica. The long, desultory and weary struggle effectively ended at the Battle of the Dunes (1658) where the French army under Vicomte de Turenne (along with some English help) defeated the remnants of the Spanish army of the Netherlands.
Committed to stopping Henry from becoming King of France, the Spanish divided their army in the Netherlands and invaded France in 1590.
Achieving the political goals of the Habsburg dynasty – which primarily meant undermining the power of France, maintaining Catholic Habsburg hegemony in Germany, and suppressing the Ottoman Empire – was more important to the Habsburg rulers than the welfare of Spain.
The patchy empire, held together by a determined king keeping the bloated bureaucracy together, unraveled when a weak ruler came to the throne.
Charles II, the last Habsburg king of Spain (r. 1665–1700)
1621–1665) by Velázquez Olivares was a man sadly out of time; he realized that Spain needed to reform, and to reform it needed peace.
St. Quentin to Lepanto (1556–1571)[edit]
Spain was now in personal union under Ferdinand II of Aragon.
Under the protection of the Schmalkaldic League, the Protestant states committed a number of outrages in the eyes of the Catholic Church— the confiscation of some ecclesiastical territories, among other things— and defied the authority of the Emperor.
His Spanish inheritance included all the Spanish possessions in the New World and around the Mediterranean. Upon the death of his Habsburg father in 1506, Charles had inherited the Netherlands and Franche-Comté, growing up in Flanders.
Olivares, who had backed certain tax measures in Spain pending the completion of the war, was further blamed for an embarrassing and fruitless war in Italy (see War of the Mantuan Succession).
However, the government was in enormous debt and declared bankruptcy that year. Philip's ambitions were beyond his country's ability to pay for them, although silver from Mexico and Peru compensated somewhat.
However, like in England, there began in Spain an inclosure movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities.

This meant that taxes, infrastructure improvement, and internal trade policy were defined independently by each region, leading to many internal customs barriers and tolls, and conflicting policies even within the Habsburg domains.
To keep the Netherlands under control required an extensive occupation force, and Spain was still financially strapped since the 1576 bankruptcy.
Pope Clement VII switched sides and now joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, in the War of the League of Cognac.
The troubled king (1571–1598)[edit]
Ferdinand's first investment of Spanish forces came in the War of the League of Cambrai against Venice, where the Spanish soldiers distinguished themselves on the field alongside their French allies at the Battle of Agnadello (1509).
Without the firm hand and diligence of Charles I and Philip II, the bureaucracy became increasingly bloated and corrupt that, by Olivares's dismissal in 1643, its deterioration had rendered it largely ineffective. Economy[edit]
After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at White Mountain in 1621, and again at Stadtlohn in 1623.
With France defeated, Charles went to take care of an older problem: the Schmalkaldic League.
The Peace of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559 concluded the war with France, leaving Spain at a considerable advantage.
This last war was again paid for by the mass production of worthless coins.
Europa regina, associated with a Habsburg-dominated Europe under Charles V. Perhaps more important to the strategy of the Spanish king, the League had allied itself with the French, and efforts in Germany to undermine the League had been rebuffed.
At the Battle of the Downs in 1639 a Spanish fleet was destroyed by the Dutch navy, and the Spanish found themselves unable to adequately reinforce and supply their forces in the Netherlands.
Spain made a fair recovery during the truce, ordering her finances and doing much to restore her prestige and stability in the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would play as the leading power.
In the "année de Corbie", 1636, Spanish forces advanced as far south as Amiens and Corbie, threatening Paris and quite nearly ending the war on their terms.

Credit emerged as a widespread tool of Spanish business in the 17th century.
Even so, Spain's economy (especially in Castile) crumbled and its population decreased by nearly two million people during the 17th century.
The Peace of Barcelona, signed between Charles and the pope in 1529, established a more cordial relationship between the two leaders that effectively named Spain as the protector of the Catholic cause and recognized Charles as king of Lombardy in return for Spanish intervention in overthrowing the rebellious Florentine Republic.

Under the Habsburgs, Spain dominated Europe politically and militarily for much of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but experienced a gradual decline of influence in the second half of the seventeenth century under the later Habsburg kings.
Philip sat back and watched the fighting go on while giving aid to the Catholic League, although occasionally also helping the Protestant side if he saw that he could gain an advantage from it.
The supply of Almadén mercury, vital to extracting silver from the ore, was controlled by the state and contributed to the rigor of Spanish tax policy.
Although the Spanish army was soundly defeated at the Battle of Ceresole, in Savoy Henry fared better, and France was forced to accept terms.
The Spanish were quite successful in enforcing the tax throughout their vast empire in the New World; all bullion had to pass through the House of Trade in Seville, under the direction of the Council of the Indies.
Although these trends laid the foundation for the development of capitalism in Spain and Europe as a whole, the total lack of regulation and pervasive corruption meant that small landowners often lost everything with a single stroke of misfortune.
Santander, on the northern Atlantic coast, grew in wealth from its traditional roles as a port linking the country's interior with northern Europe and as a ship building centre.
The Emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic Battle of Mühlberg in 1547.
The average cost of goods quintupled in the 16th century in Spain, led by wool and grain.
The expedition ended in disaster and Sebastian's disappearance at the Battle of the Three Kings. His aged uncle Henry ruled until he died in 1580.
The Moriscos of southern Spain had been forcibly converted to Christianity in 1502, but under the rule of Charles I they had been able to obtain a degree of tolerance from their Christian rulers. They were allowed to practice their former custom, dress, and language, and religious laws were laxly enforced.
Meanwhile, the Portuguese took advantage of the Catalan revolt to declare their own independence in 1640.
Freed from any serious French opposition, Spain saw the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559–1643. The Triumph of Death (c.

Instead, Spain became the scion of the Counter-reformation as it emerged from the Reconquista.
Philip II distrusted the nobility and discouraged any independent initiative among them.
The Castilian cities of Burgos, Segovia, Cuenca and Toledo, flourished with the expansion of the textile and metellurgical industries.
The time for rejoicing in Madrid was short-lived.
The Protestant Reformation had begun in Germany in 1517.
Richelieu decided that the recently signed Peace of Prague was contrary to French interests and declared war on the Holy Roman Emperor and Spain within months of the peace being signed.
Only a year later, Ferdinand joined the Holy League against France, seeing a chance at taking both Naples — to which he held a dynastic claim — and Navarre, which was claimed through his marriage to Germaine of Foix.
The development of Spain itself was hampered by the fact that Charles I and Philip II spent most of their time abroad; for most of the 16th century, Spain was administrated from Brussels and Antwerp, and it was only during the Dutch Revolt that Philip returned to Spain, where he spent most of his time in the seclusion of the monastic palace of El Escorial.
Spain also had to deal with Ottoman backed Barbary piracy in the Mediterranean - a vastly greater menace than Caribbean piracy, as well as Oriental and Dutch piracy in the waters around the Philippines.
Charles retired to the monastery of Yuste (Extremadura, Spain), where he is thought to have had a nervous breakdown, and died in 1558.
Spain, which along with England was Europe's only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth.
Faced with the growing threat of piracy, in 1564 the Spanish adopted a convoy system far ahead of its time, with treasure fleets leaving the Americas in April and August.

It became a method for enemies, jealous friends and even quarreling relations to usurp influence and property.
Charles' successor, Philip II, aggressively conducted the war against France, crushing a French army at the Battle of St. Quentin in Picardy in 1557 and defeating Henry again at the Battle of Gravelines the following year.
Only two convoys were captured; one in 1628 when it was captured by the Dutch, and another in 1656, captured by the English, but by then the convoys were a shadow of what they had been at their peak at the end of the previous century. Nevertheless even without being completely captured they frequently came under attack, which inevitably took its toll.
The situation for the Catholics improved with Gustav's death at Lutzen in 1632 and a shocking victory for Imperial forces under Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand and Ferdinand II of Hungary at Nordlingen in 1634.
France and England also supported the Portuguese pretender, Antonio of Crato.

This was partially due to plague outbreaks, and partially due to the huge casualties caused by almost continuous warfare.
The English defeated it easily, but the long war of attrition there had drained England of money, men, and morale: Elizabeth's successor, James I, wanted a fresh start to his reign.
The auto de fe was an edifying spectacle of public humiliation of the repentant before they were sent off to the civil authorities, for execution.
In 1560, the Ottomans inflicted a serious defeat on the Spanish navy off the coast of Tunisia, but in 1565, the Ottoman landing on the strategically vital island of Malta, defended by the Knights of St. John, was defeated.
After three days of fighting with the English fleet, the Armada withdrew and was forced to make a terrible journey around the coast of Scotland and Ireland, many ships being wrecked by storms. Only half of the fleet returned home alive.

After Portugal declared independence and chose the Duke of Braganza as King John IV, Spain was distracted with a Revolt in Andalusia and thus was helpless to do anything about it.
Peace with England and France implied that Spain could focus her energies on restoring her rule to the Dutch provinces.
Spain was not yet at peace, as the aggressive Henry II of France came to the throne in 1547 and immediately renewed the conflict with Spain.

At that point, Emperor and King Charles was the most powerful man in Christendom.
Seville, which was home to 60,000 people in 1500 burgeoned to 150,000 by the end of the century.

In 1519, with the death of his paternal grandfather Maximilian I, Charles inherited the Habsburg territories in Germany, and was duly elected as Holy Roman Emperor that year.
In 1521 Francis invaded the Spanish possessions in Italy and Navarre, which inaugurated a second round of Franco-Spanish conflict.
In 1527, due to Charles' inability to pay them sufficiently, his armies in Northern Italy mutinied and sacked Rome itself for loot, forcing Clement, and succeeding popes, to be considerably more prudent in their dealings with secular authorities: in 1533, Clement's refusal to annul Henry VIII of England's marriage to Catherine of Aragon (Charles' aunt) was a direct consequence of his unwillingness to offend the emperor and perhaps have his capital sacked a second time.
In 1543, Francis I, king of France, announced his unprecedented alliance with the Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, by occupying the Spanish-controlled city of Nice in cooperation with Turkish forces.
In 1555, Charles signed the Peace of Augsburg with the Protestant states and restored stability in Germany on his principle of cuius regio, eius religio ("whose realm, his religion"), a position unpopular with the Spanish and Italian clergy.
In 1556 he abdicated from his positions, giving his Spanish empire to his only surviving son, Philip II of Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire to his brother, Ferdinand.
In 1559, three years after Philip came to power, students in Spain were forbidden to travel abroad, the leaders of the Inquisition were placed in charge of censorship, and books could no longer be imported.
Only in response to raids on the eastern coast of Spain did Charles personally lead attacks against holdings in North Africa (1545).
In 1566, Calvinist-led riots in the Spanish Netherlands (roughly equal to modern-day Netherlands and Belgium, inherited by Philip from Charles and his Burgundian forebearers) prompted the Duke of Alva to conduct a military expedition to restore order. Alva launched an ensuing reign of terror.
(However, Charles also passed the Limpieza de sangre, a law that excluded those not of pure Old Christian, non-Jewish blood from public office.) Philip began to put back into place the restrictive laws of generations before and in 1568 the Moriscos rebelled (see Morisco Revolt).
The death of Suleiman the Magnificent the following year and his succession by the less capable Selim the Sot emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the Ottoman homelands. In 1571, a mixed naval expedition of Spanish, Venetian, and papal ships led by Charles' illegitimate son Don John of Austria annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto, in the largest naval battle fought in European waters since Actium in 31 BC.
In 1572, a band of rebel Dutch privateers known as the watergeuzen ("Sea Beggars") seized a number of Dutch coastal towns, proclaimed their support for William and denounced the Spanish leadership.
In 1574, the Spanish army under Luis de Requeséns was repulsed from the Siege of Leiden after the Dutch destroyed the dykes that held back the North Sea from the low-lying provinces.
In 1576, faced with the costs of his 80,000-man army of occupation in the Netherlands and the massive fleet that had won at Lepanto, Philip was forced to accept bankruptcy.
Although Philip had long prepared for the takeover of Portugal, he still found it necessary to launch a military occupation led by the Duke of Alva.

In 1586, Queen Elizabeth I of England, supported the Protestant cause in the Netherlands and France, and Sir Francis Drake launched attacks against Spanish merchants in the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, along with a particularly aggressive attack on the port of Cadiz.
In 1588, hoping to put a stop to Elizabeth's meddling, Philip sent the Spanish Armada to attack England.
In 1589, Henry III, the last of the Valois lineage, died at the walls of Paris.
Fortunately, Spanish forces had regained enough of the military initiative to convince a politically divided United Provinces to sign a truce in 1609.
In 1609, on the advice of the Duke of Lerma, Philip III expelled the 300,000 Moriscos of Spain.
The war that had been going on between the two countries since 1585 finally ended.
In 1618, beginning with the Defenestration of Prague, Austria and the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II of Germany, embarked on a campaign against the Protestant Union and Bohemia.
Thus, Spain entered into the Thirty Years’ War. In 1621, Philip III died and his son succeeded as Philip IV. The militarists now were firmly in charge.
In 1625, a peak of Spanish prestige and power, the Count-Duke of Olivares established the Jesuit colegia imperial in Madrid to train Spanish nobles in the humanities and military arts. The expulsion of the Moriscos from Valencia
In 1627, the Castilian economy collapsed.

Portuguese victories in 1663 at Ameixial and in 1665 at Vila Viçosa secured their independence, and in 1668 Spain recognized Portugal's sovereignty.
The Habsburg rulers (chiefly Charles I and Philip II) reached the zenith of their influence and power, controlling territory, including the Americas, the East Indies, the Low Countries and territories now in France and Germany in Europe, the Portuguese Empire from 1580 to 1640, and various other territories such as small enclaves like Ceuta and Oran in North Africa.
Among the most outstanding figures of this period were Teresa of Ávila, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Miguel de Cervantes, El Greco, Domingo de Soto, Francisco Suárez, Diego Velázquez, and Francisco de Vitoria.
To bring finance into order the military campaigns were reduced and the over-stretched forces went into a largely defensive mode.
In 1646, his eldest son and heir Don Baltasar Carlos died at the age of 16.
In the 1520s silver began to be extracted from the rich deposits at Guanajuato, but it was not until the 1540s, with the opening of the mines at Potosí and Zacatecas, that silver was to become the fabled source of wealth it has assumed in legend.
In the Netherlands, the rule of Philip II's daughter, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and her husband, Archduke Albert, restored stability to the southern Netherlands and pacified anti-Spanish sentiments in the area.
In 1526, Charles married Infanta Isabella, the sister of John III of Portugal.
In the celebrations that followed the treaty, Henry was killed by a stray splinter from a lance.

Eventually, overtaxed Castile became barren, and Spain, particularly Castile, became dependent on large imports of grain to make up for crop shortfalls, that, given the cost of transportation and the risk of piracy, made staples far more expensive in Spain than elsewhere.
Altogether, Habsburg Spain was for well over a century, the world's greatest power. Consequently, this period of Spanish history has also been referred to as the "Age of Expansion".
The Ottoman Empire had long menaced the fringes of the Habsburg dominions in Austria and northwest Africa, and in response Ferdinand and Isabella had sent expeditions to North Africa, capturing Melilla in 1497 and Oran in 1509.

She experienced a mystical ecstasy that became profoundly influential on Spanish culture and art.
Shortly thereafter Joanna began to lapse into insanity, though how mentally ill she actually was has been the topic of some debate.
For a short time under Don Juan José de Austria as valido the nobility came to dominate Spain once again.
The German Peasants' War broke out in Germany in 1524 and ravaged the country until it was brutally put down in 1526; Charles, even as far away from Germany as he was, was committed to keeping order.
The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeats at Biccoca (1522), Pavia (1525, at which Francis was captured), and Landriano (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned Milan to Spain once more.
However, they did not see it that way, and refused to help with the campaign. The quartering of Spanish troops in Catalonia only made the situation worse, and the Catalans decided to secede from Spain altogether and unite with France.
Others tried to weaken the power of the Inquisition (which however was not abolished until 1808) and encourage economic development.
Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, and the war seemed to be going in Spain's favor.
The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of Breda in 1625.
Supported by the French, the Catalonians, Neapolitans, and Portuguese rose up in revolt against the Spanish in the 1640s.
The intervention of the Danish king Christian IV in the war worried some (Christian was one of Europe's few monarchs who had no worries over his finances) but the victory of the Imperial general Albert of Wallenstein over the Danes at Dessau Bridge and again at Lutter, both in 1626, eliminated the threat.
Following the peace with England, the new Spanish commander Ambrosio Spinola pressed hard against the Dutch.

Philip succeeded three times with popes Urban VII, Gregory XIV, and Innocent IX.
Southern cities like Cadiz and Seville expanded rapidly from the commerce and shipbuilding spurred on by the demands of the American colonies. Barcelona, already one of Europe's most important and sophisticated trading port cities in the Middle Ages, continued to develop.
France formed the cornerstone of Spanish foreign policy, because its strength was potentially very great, and its hostility to Spain was total. But for 30 years after Cateau-Cambresis, it was engulfed in civil wars.
Juana Inés de la Cruz, the last great writer of this golden age, died in New Spain in 1695.
He was willing to do whatever it took to fight the heretics and preserve Spanish hegemony, even intervening in papal elections to ensure the choosing of a pro-Spanish pope through bribery and threats.
One of Spain's best and most famous armies had suffered total defeat on the battlefield. The myth of Spanish invincibility was shattered.
Instead of fueling the Spanish economy, American silver made the country increasingly dependent on foreign sources of raw materials and manufactured goods.
But as precious metal shipments rapidly expanded late in the century it contributed to the general inflation that was affecting the whole of Europe.
War with France threatened in 1610, but shortly after, Henry IV was assassinated, and the country fell into civil war again. Up until 1630, Spain was at peace and continued its dominant position in Europe, but this was partly because its enemies were disorganized and divided.

From a position of strength, the Emperor approached the war-weary German states with a peace in 1635; many accepted, including the two most powerful, Brandenburg and Saxony.
The Armada's goal was to ferry Spanish troops from the Netherlands to invade England, in spite of the fact that Spain had no deep-water ports in the North Sea.
The accumulation of so much power by one man and one dynasty greatly concerned Francis I of France, who found himself surrounded by Habsburg territories.
In 1506, he was declared jure uxoris king, but he died later that year under mysterious circumstances, possibly poisoned by his father-in-law.[2] Since their oldest son Charles was only six, the Cortes reluctantly allowed Joanna's father Ferdinand to rule the country as the regent of Joanna and Charles.

On 7 June 2009, unconfirmed reports quoting French media and citing sources "close to the French government" reported that Bongo had died in Spain of complications from advanced intestinal cancer .[39][59] The Government of Gabon denied the reports, which had been picked up by numerous other news sources, and continued to insist that he was well.
Bongo was criticized for in effect having worked for himself, his family and local elites and not for Gabon and its people.
 "It is a great and loyal friend of France who has left us — a grand figure of Africa" Sarkozy said in a statement.[26]

Illness and death[edit]
Alain Bernard Bongo, later known as Ali-Ben Bongo, served as Foreign Minister from 1989 to 1991, then Defence Minister from 1999 to 2009, and was then elected president in August 2009 to replace his father.[50]

Bongo went on to preside over an oil boom that undoubtedly fueled an extravagant lifestyle for him and his family—dozens of luxurious properties in and around France, a US$800 million presidential palace in Gabon, fancy cars, etc.[27] This enabled him to amass enough wealth to become one of the world's richest men.[39] He carefully allowed just enough oil money to trickle down to the general population of 1.4 million, thus avoiding mass unrest.[42] He built some basic infrastructure in Libreville and, ignoring advice to establish a road network instead, constructed the US$4bn Trans-Gabon Railway line deep into the forested interior.

A French court decision in February 2009 to freeze his bank accounts added fuel to the fire and his government accused France of waging a "campaign to destabilise" the country.[38] It is for this reason that he was hospitalized and spent his last days in Barcelona, Spain and not in France.

He accepted that there was still not enough money to fund the election and agreed to help Côte d'Ivoire find African and international financial assistance, although he said that France would not send any more of its own money.
In an assessment of the public identification hearings on 10 April 2008, the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (ONUCI) said that 400,000 back-up birth certificates had been issued over the course of six months and that 7,337 public hearings had been held in 11 administrative areas.[38]

The cost of this program was estimated at about 44.4 billion CFA francs, and financing for it was to be partially provided by the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme.[60]
Voter identification and registration[edit]
A security plan for the election was approved by the commanders of the Ivorian forces and the ONUCI peacekeeping forces on 12 September 2008.
Identification was expected to be completed by February 2009.[42]
In early 2009, Innocent Anaky, the President of the Movement of the Forces of the Future (MFA), said that he did not believe that the election would actually be held in 2009.[32]
Alassane Ouattara, who was Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993, was designated as the presidential candidate of the Rally of the Republicans (RDR) at a congress of his party held on 1–3 February 2008.
Soro announced on 14 May 2009, that the election would be held on 29 November 2009.

Once the electoral register was completed, there was to be a one-month period during which the register could be challenged; however, Gbagbo said shortly before the beginning of the census that he wanted this period for challenges to be reduced to 15 days.
In addition, all of the New Forces soldiers being demobilized were to be paid 50,000 CFA francs.[63]
Paul Yao N'Dre, the President of the Constitutional Council then took to the airwaves to say that the CEI had no authority left to announce any results, because it had already missed its deadline to announce them, and consequently the results were invalid.[6][82] N'Dre announced that the results in seven northern regions were cancelled, thereby swinging the outcome narrowly in favor of Gbagbo, who was credited with 51.45% of the vote while Ouattara had 48.55%.[83] According to article 94 of the Ivorian Constitution, the Constitutional Council decides on electoral disputes, and proclaims the definitive results of presidential elections.[10]
In a statement on 15 May, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on "all Ivorian parties to respect this date and to work together to complete the remaining tasks related to the electoral process."[33]
Describing himself as an "arbiter of the electoral process", Soro said in a March 2008 interview with Jeune Afrique that the New Forces would not back any candidate and its members could vote for whomever they wished.
Soro, as Prime Minister, is barred from standing as a candidate by the peace agreement.
Rumors have suggested that Soro and Gbagbo have secretly agreed on an arrangement whereby Soro would support Gbagbo and, in exchange, Gbagbo would back Soro in the subsequent presidential election; Soro derided these rumors as "gossip".[49]
After fighting the Second Ivorian Civil War, Gbagbo was forcefully removed from office and Ouattara took office as the undisputed president on April 11, 2011.

Despite Bédié's position, Gbagbo's campaign hoped to draw some of Bédié's supporters over to their candidate's side.
He argued that the organization of the election could falter if it was not driven by a clear objective.[69] Election[edit]
Blaise Compaoré, the President of Burkina Faso, said that the progress of voter registration had to be considered in setting any new date, while expressing his hope that registration would be finished before 1 January 2009.
International funding and involvement[edit]
The government said that it did not have the money to fund rehabilitation projects.[56]
43,000 former rebels were planned to ultimately be involved in the process, which is intended to last for about five months, with completion envisioned by late September, according to New Forces General Soumaïla Bakayoko.
No results were announced.[79][80] In a tense atmosphere, each side accused the other of attempting to win the election through fraud.

On 14 June, Kouchner visited Côte d'Ivoire and met with Gbagbo and Ouattara, among others.
The second meeting of the Cadre permanent de concertation (CPC), which is responsible for the implementation of the peace agreement, was concluded in Ouagadougou on 24 January 2008.
Disarmament and security[edit]
Kumalo credited the unprecedented progress that had been made over the previous year to Ivorian control of the process, and he said that the UN had only an "accompanying" role.
The PDCI and RDR welcomed the announcement of a date, although they remained cautious; the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire also welcomed it.

In an interview with Agence France Presse on 20 May 2007, Henri Konan Bédié, who was President from 1993 to 1999, said that he would be the presidential candidate of his party, the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire - African Democratic Rally (PDCI-RDA), in the 2008 election.
By the first half of September 2008, there was widespread speculation that the election could be again delayed to early 2009.[25] Gbagbo said in mid-September that a delay to 15 December would be needed unless the period allowed for challenges to the electoral register was truncated;[26][27] however, CEI President Robert Mambé said on 18 September that such a delay was "out of the question" for the time being, noting that the CEI considered meeting the 30 November date to be "a moral obligation".[28]
According to the New Forces, eight of the attackers were killed, along with one of their own men.[62]
Although no leading political figures had yet expressed that view, in March Gbagbo referred to the importance of considering actual conditions and said that it would not mean "death" if the election was not held in June.[22]
The public hearings of the identification process were intended for people born in Côte d'Ivoire who did not yet have identification papers.
On 27 November 2007, Gbagbo and Guillaume Soro reached an agreement in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, that the election would be held by the end of June 2008; the electoral commission was to propose the specific date of the election.[19] Gbagbo reiterated on 19 December that the election would be held no later than the end of June 2008, and he said that he would visit all the regions held by the New Forces by March 2008 and would then make a report to the Constitutional Council, which would in turn approve the holding of the election.[20]
Originally scheduled to be held in 2005, the vote was delayed several times due to the Ivorian Civil War and difficulties involved in the organization and preparation of the election.
The second round was held on 28 November 2010. Results for the diaspora vote were announced first, on 29 November 2010; Ouattara had 6,371 votes (59.97%) and Gbagbo had 4,252 votes (40.03%).[78] This batch of results was too small to be particularly meaningful, however.
Gbagbo, Soro, and Compaoré signed an agreement on 24 December 2008, according to which 5,000 New Forces soldiers would be integrated into the army over the course of two years, while another 3,400 would enter the police and gendarmerie.
Ouattara announcement[edit] On the basis of the CEI's results, Ouattara maintained that he was "the elected President" and said that the Constitutional Council had abused its authority.[84]

On 22 December 2007, a disarmament process planned to take place over the course of three months began with government soldiers and former rebels[who?] withdrawing from their positions near what had been the buffer zone; the forces of the two sides respectively went to barracks in Yamoussoukro and Bouaké.
Additionally, the Security Council called for the establishment of a clear timetable for holding the election.
A New Forces camp in Seguela was attacked on 24 November 2008; the attackers were said to have freed prisoners and attempted to take guns and ammunition.
Ouattara, for his part, accused Gbagbo of working "to divide Ivorians, to bring war to Ivory Coast and to loot the resources of one tribe and one clan", and he said that Gbagbo's accusations were lies.[77]
Gbagbo declared that the election was "a true battle between the democrats and the coup leaders", accusing Ouattara of orchestrating both the 1999 coup that ousted Bédié and the 2002 coup attempt that failed to topple Gbagbo and set off the civil war.
According to Lobognon, "the peace process is in danger because the prime minister does not have the means to implement his policies", and he described the situation as a "crisis".[59]
As the polls closed for the first round, more unrest was feared as the former rebels were still armed in the north, powerful militias still existed in the west and neither armed group was willing to accept defeat.[70] The second round date was confirmed despite opposition allegations of fraud and demands for a recount of the first round of votes.[71]
At a meeting of the Ivorian political parties in Ouagadougou on 10 November 2008, it was decided, as expected, that the 30 November date could not be met and a delay was necessary.

Bakayoko, the former New Forces commander, also spoke to the Security Council, saying that disarmament was proceeding "little by little".[66]
Before any further results were announced, Gbagbo supporters began raising objections to the conduct of the election in the overwhelmingly pro-Ouattara north of the country; they alleged disruptive and abusive behavior by Ouattara supporters that invalidated the results in certain regions, or even the election as a whole.[79] Bamba Yacouba, speaking for the CEI, attempted to announce the first significant batch of results at a press conference on 30 November, but a pro-Gbagbo member of the CEI, Damana Adia Pickass, snatched the papers away from him and tore them to pieces, contesting the validity of the results Yacouba was preparing to announce.
At this meeting, it was decided to facilitate voter registration for those individuals receiving supplementary birth certificates through the identification process, to allow parties to begin campaigning in February, and to publish the voter list from the 2000 presidential election on the Internet.[37]
Soro was to present a report on the peace process and CEI President Robert Mambé was to present a report on CEI's work.[65] The meeting concluded with a communiqué urgently appealing to the international community to provide financing for the electoral process.
Ouattara said that a date should only be set when "good visibility" existed, while Bédié said that they had "put the cart before the horse" and that a new date should not be set until it was clear that the identification process was successful.[31]
Although the mandate of ONUCI and French peacekeepers was set to expire on 30 July 2008, the UN Security Council unanimously voted on 29 July to extend the mandate to 31 January 2009 so that the peacekeepers could "support the organization of free, open, fair and transparent elections".
Bédié's support was largely concentrated among members of the Baoulé ethnic group.

Bédié, meanwhile, initially hesitated to provide his expected endorsement of Ouattara; Bédié's position was considered a crucial factor for the second round, as the votes of his supporters could decide the outcome of the election.
Afterward, Gbagbo was indicted and arrested by the International Criminal Court.
Results had been expected and then postponed for days, beyond the deadline, and Bakayoko's appearance to announce the results—at an Abidjan hotel heavily guarded by the United Nations—took the press by surprise.[81] Bakayoko reportedly chose to announce the results at the hotel, which Ouattara had been using as "his base", because he wanted to have the security of UN protection when doing so.[82]

Following the March 2007 agreement with the New Forces, the election was planned to be held in the first quarter of 2008.[2] On 6 August 2007, President Laurent Gbagbo said it would be possible, with goodwill and determination, to hold the election as early as December 2007.[14][15] This was greeted with widespread skepticism by observers and the opposition, who said that the preparations for elections would be incomplete at such an early stage.[15]
As part of the process, each of the former rebels were planned to each receive 90,000 CFA francs per month for three months; the first of these monthly payments occurred in May.[56] A delay in the June payment caused unrest among the New Forces in Bouaké.[57]
Bédié and Ouattara had been seen all along as somewhat incongruous allies, in light of their 1990s rivalry, and Bédié's hesitation suggested to some that their alliance was tenuous.[75] Bédié endorsed Ouattara shortly thereafter, however.
1,500 of the necessary 6,000 cases of material for voter registration cards arrived in Côte d'Ivoire on 10 August 2008, according to Sagem; the remaining material was expected to arrive within one week.[39]
On 29 April, Ouattara called for the public identification hearings, which were due to end in May, to be extended by one or two months, saying that many people had not yet been able to participate.[38]
The third meeting of the CPC, chaired by Compaoré,[64] was held on 9 May at the House of Deputies in Yamoussoukro; those present included Gbagbo, Soro, Ouattara, and Bédié.
At the congress, he invited the New Forces, from whom he had previously distanced himself, to team up with the RDR for the election.[47]
Mambé, for his part, said that he was actively working to finalize the system of voter registration, and he called on electoral observers to begin observing the registration process, rather than waiting until "two or three days before the election to observe".
UN envoy Choi Young-jin expressed concern that "for the first time since the signing of the Ouagadougou peace deal in March 2007, the Ivorian people and the international community have neither a date nor a timeframe for the elections."
On 7 May, several other countries, including France, Japan, and the United States, announced that they were providing 115 billion CFA francs in aid money to fund the election and the process of resolving the civil war.
Gbagbo and Soro were present at Tiebissou to mark the event; Gbagbo said that, as a result, the front lines of the conflict no longer existed, and Soro said that it "effectively, concretely marks the beginning of disarmament".[53] Government forces completed their withdrawal from the front lines on 24 January 2008.[54]
Ouattara's camp alleged that Gbagbo's aim was "obstructing the electoral commission and confiscating power".[79] At an RDR office in pro-Gbagbo territory in Abidjan, eight Ouattara supporters were reportedly shot and killed by security forces late on 1 December 2010.[6]
Controversy[edit]
Candidates Parties 1st round 2nd round
Members of the New Forces loyal to Zacharia Koné, a New Forces commander who was dismissed from his command in May 2008 for indiscipline, briefly mutinied in Vavoua and Seguela on 28 June.[58] An aide to Soro, Alain Lobognon, subsequently said on 30 June that the government did not have enough money to complete the disarmament and implementation of the peace agreement, complaining that the international community was not sending aid.
There were 5.4 million registered voters at the time of the 2000 presidential election; it was expected that the number of registered voters for the new election could be up to eight million.[36] However, in early December 2008 only 2 million voters had registered.[41]
According to Koné, the date was chosen by the CEI, which had presented a report to the government.
According to ONUCI, the program was intended "to create a stable security environment for free and transparent elections by re-introducing ex-fighters socially and economically back into their old communities".
On 2 December 2010, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) released provisional results showing that Ouattara had won the election in the second round with 54% of the vote.
The New Forces have blamed the stalling of the process on lack of money.[55]
The New Forces and Prime Minister Soro both supported Ouattara's claim to victory;[85] Soro said that he considered Ouattara the rightful President and offered his resignation to Ouattara on 4 December.[86]
The RDR and the PDCI-RDA are both members of the Rally of Houphouëtistes, and while Ouattara and Bédié will run separately in the first round of the presidential election, each has agreed to support the other if only one of them makes it into a potential second round.[47]
Despite the Council's concerns about security, Gbagbo did not feel that this would be a problem; Ouattara said that it was important for UN peacekeepers to ensure security during the election.
While Ouattara and Bédié have said that full implementation of the peace agreement, including total disarmament of the New Forces, is not necessary prior to the holding of the election, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the President of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI), Gbagbo's party, has said that disarmament must be completed before the election.[48]
The election, in which ethnicity and the country's north-south divide played a crucial role, ultimately pitted President Gbagbo, who had a strong support base in the south, against the long-time opposition leader and former Prime Minister Ouattara, who had overwhelming support in much of the north.
French Minister of Foreign Affairs Bernard Kouchner said on 27 January 2008 that the election might be delayed slightly past the end of June deadline due to technical requirements, particularly the need to update voter lists.[21]
Expatriate ballots had former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara ahead of incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo, with former President Henri Konan Bédié in third place.[72] Some other sources put Bédié in the lead with 42% to Gbagbo's 31% and Ouattara's 24%.[73] Official provisional results had Gbagbo in the lead with 38.3%, Ouattara with 32.1% and Bédié with 25.2%.[74] The opposition parties called for a recount, but the Constitutional Council quickly announced official results and confirmed Gbagbo's first round lead.[75]
The electoral census began on 15 September and was planned to continue for 30 to 45 days.
The World Bank has halted loans to the country and travel restrictions have been placed on Gbagbo and his political allies.[12] The rising political tensions resulted in a sharp jump in cocoa prices, up to an increase of 10 percent.
On 7 November, the UN Security Council called for the election to be held by mid-2009 at the latest.
Choi Young-jin, the UN Special Representative to Côte d'Ivoire, launched an ONUCI program in Bouaké on 15 August to fund 1,000 microprojects for those members of the New Forces who were not integrated into the army.
Bakayoko said that about 22,000 former rebels would "receive funding to carry out micro-projects", while the remainder would be integrated into the army.[54] The numbers were later given as 36,000 total, with 10,000 to be integrated and 26,000 to participate in rehabilitation projects or national civic service.

On the same day, Gbagbo signed a decree outlining the terms of cooperation between the National Institute of Statistics and the French company Sagem, the latter of which is tasked with surveying the population so that voter lists can be updated and new voter cards can be created.[24]
The hearings were launched on 25 September 2007, and were to be held first in Ouragahio and Ferkessédougou, respectively the home regions of Gbagbo and Prime Minister Guillaume Soro.[35] Gbagbo asserted that there were about 300,000 eligible voters who could be identified through the process, but the New Forces said that there were up to three million eligible voters.[36] The French company Sagem was designated as the technical operator of the electoral register in November 2007.[22]
The first round was held on 31 October 2010[1] and a second round, in which President Laurent Gbagbo faced opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, was held on 28 November 2010.
According to Soro, another 35 billion CFA francs are needed.[64]
Post-election conflict[edit] Main article: 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis CEI announcement[edit]
However the President of the Constitutional Council immediately declared that the results were invalid[6] and the next day, in accordance with article 94 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Council declared Gbagbo the winner.[7] Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory and took the presidential oath of office.
The process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the New Forces, which had been launched on 22 December 2007, began in Bouaké on 2 May 2008 with 1,000 former rebels.
At a New Forces meeting on 11 October, the group recommended that the election be postponed to 2009, citing concerns about security and inadequate progress in identity card distribution.[29] Speaking on 29 October, Prime Minister Soro suggested the possibility of a delay, saying that the CEI had been asked "to work out a reliable time-frame to give us an idea of a probable definitive date for the election".[30]
Proclamation of the Constitutional Council[edit]
Second round[edit]
South Africa's Ambassador to the UN, Dumisani Kumalo, observed that, in contrast to the situation a year beforehand, all sides appeared committed to holding the election on a specific date.
Both sides employed harsh rhetoric at their rallies, denouncing their opponents as practically criminal.
He said that his party was impatient for the election to be held, and also said that the opposition would not back a single candidate in the first round of the election.[43] Bédié addressed a rally in Dabou on 22 September 2007, in which he declared the need for a "shock treatment" to return the country to normal,[44][45] promised to restore the economy,[45] and strongly criticized Gbagbo.[46]

Needless to say, expectations for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception were extremely high.
It featured a fun sharply-written script, engaging gameplay, a brilliant soundtrack and the best cinematic pacing ever presented in a videogame.

Uncharted 3 was placed at number three on Big Picture Big Sound's "Top 10 Best Games of E3 2011" column,[134] and was included in GamesRadar's and Official PlayStation Magazine's "Most Valuable Game Award".[135] Uncharted 3 was also on display for the general video game audience at the 2011 Gamescom, and received one nomination for "Best Console Game".[136] Numerous gaming websites have called Uncharted 3 one of the most anticipated games of 2011,[137][138][139][140][141] with 1UP and IGN ranking it number one in their "Top 10 PS3 Games of 2011" column.[142][143] Metacritic included Uncharted 3 on their "Most Anticipated Games of 2011" column, and stated that "Sony's console has an unusually large lineup of exclusives scheduled for 2011, highlighted by one of the year's biggest titles, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception."[144] In Japan, gaming magazine Famitsu had it listed as one of the most anticipated games in its periodic reader poll.[145] Many shops around the country had large displays advertising its November 2 launch date.[146]

Exclusive to North America is the Collector's Edition.
Along with the retail release of the game, Sony announced day-one DLC will be available as well.
Three classic skin packs featuring total of 25 character skins from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves was released on PlayStation Network.
Members of the "Fortune Hunters' Club" got these three classic skin packs for free.[107]
Fortune Hunter was a partial recreation of the Yemen level from the Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception multiplayer mode, and a cover-based shooting system complete with weapons and gameplay inspired by the Uncharted series.
On November 15, 2011, Killzone-themed multiplayer skin pack was released for Uncharted 3 as the "Multiplayer Accessory Pack".
On February 7, 2012, the "Fort Co-Op Adventure" was released, which sees series villains Zoran Lazarević, Eddy Raja and Harry Flynn team up in a new add-on that further explores the mystery behind the Janus head statue from the original on-disc co-op adventure.[109]
Members of the "Fortune Hunters' Club" got this pack for free as a bonus content on top of the three character skins packs from the Fortune Hunters' Club.[108]
 "Map Pack" includes 4 brand new maps (Graveyard, Old Quarter, Oasis, London Streets), each with a new dynamic event that occurs as the match progresses.
On November 15, 2011, Naughty Dog announced Uncharted 3s first major DLC add-on would be a retro map pack, called the "Flashback Map Pack #1".
Dynamic lighting effects, new particle effects, touched-up textures and various new weather effects have been added to the stages.[106]
On January 17, 2012, Naughty Dog offered some news on what to expect in the future from the game's DLC slate.
The "Rogues Skin Pack 1" and "Rogues Skin Pack 2" will let you play "as some of the major thugs and minor characters" from Uncharted 3, whereas the "Donut Skin Pack" offers super-sized versions of heroes and villains from Uncharted 3.[106] These packs were released on February 7, 2012.[109]
While we can't talk about DLC right now, I'd say the content easily amounts to hundreds and hundreds of hours.

Garrett Martin of Paste said: "Like the previous game's hotel sequence, the cruise ship segment is impressive because of how it exploits our perception of both the game's rules and our character's surroundings.
Maybe they don't buy it day one, but maybe they buy it in February? Maybe they buy it in March?

The player's rank and unlockable items were carried over into the main game.[58]
Although both multiplayer suites included the same content, interestingly, the Europen, South African, The Middle East, Australian and New Zealand didn't have the Subway items like the US.[59] Other vouchers that purchasers could get access to by picking up a Subway sandwich or chip was an Uncharted 3 dynamic PlayStation 3 theme, an Uncharted 3 Fortune Hunter Bounty ability pack, an Uncharted 3 Drake multiplayer skin, an Uncharted 3 multiplayer weapon skin or a Subway cup and sandwich virtual costume for PlayStation Home.[60]
A selection of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception themed stickers are also included.
To celebrate launch of Uncharted 3, Sony and Media Molecule released a Nathan Drake costume for LittleBigPlanet 2.

As the boat lurches downward, we have to maneuver Drake upwards through hallways and staterooms that tilt sideways, climbing up through doors and over bed frames.
PlayStation Home[edit]
Players who pre-ordered the game from several retail outlets, such as Elkjøp and Game, received another bonus pack, which consist of the six in-game multiplayer codes, as well as the "Soon-to-be action hero" T-shirt. Retail editions[edit]
Which of the pre-order bonuses the player received depended upon where they pre-ordered the game.
If the player pre-ordered Uncharted 3 from PlayStation Home, they also received an exclusive Nathan Drake costume with custom shooting animation for their PlayStation Home avatar.[61] The Uncharted 3: Fortune Hunter Total Game Integration was accessed from the Adventure District in PlayStation Home.
Meyer also spoke of what it is like to work with the PlayStation platform stating "I think it really helps.
On February 7, 2012, Naughty Dog revealed that the "Flashback Map Pack 2" is set to be released on February 21, which offers Plaza, Temple, Train Wreck and Village multiplayer stages from Uncharted 2.
Multiplayer beta[edit] A multiplayer beta for Uncharted 3 began worldwide on June 28, 2011, with early access for PlayStation Plus members and all buyers of specially marked copies of Infamous 2.
Uncharted 3 sees protagonist Nathan Drake and mentor Victor Sullivan traveling around the world to places such as the Rub' al Khali desert, in search of the legendary lost city the Iram of the Pillars, which is mentioned in the Quran.[6] Elena Fisher and Chloe Frazer also return in Uncharted 3.
Genuinely, Uncharted 3 looks phenomenal in 3D."[37] Multiplayer move free to play model[edit]
 "Drake's Deception Map Pack" is the last DLC as part of the "Uncharted 3 Fortune Hunters' Club".[112]
Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception was first officially released in North America on November 1, 2011, then November 2 in Europe and Japan, and November 3 in Australia.
While Uncharted 3 is a tremendously satisfying game and one of the best releases of 2011, it fails to fully live up to the legacy of its legendary predecessor."[179]
 "Drake's Deception Map Pack" was released on April 10, 2012.

 "We have always said that if we think that we can make something new and interesting, if the fans still want them, then we can make another one".[236] Naughty Dog has said future titles will have to live up to a "really high" quality standard.
It also includes Drake's Journal with fully illustrated pages, Screenshots and Sketches from the Game .[88]
Exclusive to Europe, Australia, Norway and New Zealand is the Special Edition, which includes a "Steelbook" journal-styled game box case packaging.
Speaking to IGN, lead effects artist Keith Guerrette said success has made the studio "a little bit reluctant, actually, if we do sit back and decide to continue with the Uncharted world, because we don't want to "ruin" the series."[237] According to Naughty Dog, it was a mistake to reveal Uncharted 3's release date a year out with the challenges involved with completing a game by its due date.
Uncharted 3 received critical acclaim, averaging 92% on review aggregate website Metacritic and 91.76% on GameRankings, making it one of the best reviewed video games of 2011.[8] It won several "Game of the Year" awards, with reviewers praising the writing, voice acting, graphics, cinematic quality and story.
Buyers were able to enter a code from a specially marked Uncharted 30 oz drink cup before November 1 to get early access to the Uncharted 3 multiplayer.
The "Traveling Chest" is replaced by the "Uncharted Wooden Travel Case", which has space for 19 PlayStation 3 games.
There is always room where you find something where you can do the processing in some different way to find more power.
Graphics and technology[edit]
It was also confirmed that the Uncharted 3 disc will also contain four behind-the-scenes videos detailing the development and production of the video game, including exclusive material from Naughty Dog.
In an interview at GamesCon 2011, Senior Manager of Marketing Communications Arne Meyer spoke of the unprecedented size of Uncharted 3 stating "Uncharted 2 barely made it to 25GB, while Naughty Dog is going over 50GB this time, for Uncharted 3.
We were using everything we possibly could.
According to Richmond, Nate still has plenty more to give and the studio would continue to create new Uncharted experiences as long as fans want it.[235] Speaking to VentureBeat, Richmond pointed out that the studio never set out to make a trilogy.
“ "We have two motion capture spaces - a smaller one in the studio that lets us pick up smaller pieces, like idles, and then we have a dedicated stage at Sony Studios, and that's where we get both the motion capture and the audio - because we do all of the dialogue at the same time - for both gameplay and cinematics.
Two Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception Complete Official Guides were released alongside with the retail release of the game, both designed by Piggyback.
On October 31, 2011, Spike's GameTrailers TV presented the Uncharted 3: Race to the Ring on Spike TV.
To this date over 3.5 million people have played over 37 million matches of multiplayer.
But again, I have no idea what the proper margins are.
Nate successfully infiltrates the plane but is discovered on board by Marlowe's men and a shoot-out ensues, resulting in a massive decompression which tears the plane apart.
The game features new innovations in sand, fire, smoke, and water dynamics and effects, also it adds to the movement of the characters, more realistic textures and animations.[28] According to Naughty Dog Uncharted 3 is graphically superior to Uncharted 2.[29] "We're at full speed, optimizing code specifically for the SPUs," Naughty Dog co-president (and former technical director) Christophe Balestra told Edge.[30] "We were, at any given point, using 100% [of the PlayStation 3's power].
The two embrace with the promise of a fresh start, and the three fly back home on Sully's new sea plane.
Cooperative multiplayer also returns from Uncharted 2. Plot[edit]
The 30-minute special featured five Uncharted fans from the United States engaged in physical and mental challenges, with the winner receiving an Uncharted-themed prize package including a Sony home theater system.[39][40]
The offer entitled fans to play all of the competitive multiplayer maps and modes a month before the game was released.
Returning to the present day, it is revealed that the meeting was an elaborate set-up by Nate and Sully to track down Marlowe, with Cutter being a friend of theirs.
We're not going away, and obviously people want to play things the day they come out, if they possibly can, but sometimes they can't."[85]
In the update; aside from inclusions such as Facebook integration and 1080i upscaling, a number of in-game elements such as medals and power plays were altered for a more balanced online experience.[70] On July 6, Naughty Dog released the third patch 1.03 in Europe and it should have fix any European connectivity issues.[71] Naughty Dog's Co-President, Christophe Balestra wrote on Twitter:
Outside the pub, Nate and Sully are subdued by Charlie Cutter (Graham McTavish), Talbot's cohort.
Naughty Dog released the first patch for the multiplayer beta on June 29, 2011, titled version 1.01.[66][67] However, some gamers still reported that their PlayStation 3 is still getting locked completely and required a hard reboot.[68] Naughty Dog wrote on Twitter:
Joy can be found in the small moments and movements of the characters, and their interactions are always fun to watch."[175] In a review for The Telegraph, Tom Hoggins described it as "If you were to break Drake's Deception down to its base elements, it's the same Uncharted we have grown to love, just a little trimmer, more slick."[176] Dan Silver of Daily Mirror concluded with "Overall, Drake's Deception is one of the most spectacular entertainment experiences ever produced, but one you'll enjoy holding a joypad rather than a bucket of popcorn.
Sadly there are no cameos from Red Buttons or Shelley Winters.
In Official PlayStation Magazine UK's interview about Uncharted 4, Richmond discusses some of the new directions that the franchise could take in the future, as well as maintaining fan interest and going too far.
Naughty Dog also promise some "major Uncharted 3 news" in the coming weeks.[114]
At the beginning of each match, the player may be joined with a random partner or a friend if joining their game.
It doesn't seem like a crazy price to me.
These items will be available for free until January 8, 2013, after which they must be earned via tournament play.[113]
The update include an in-game t-shirt adorned with the face of Naughty Dog co-president Christophe Balestra dressed as an elf and Nathan Drake with a lavishly wrapped present around his head.
The 20 competing adventurers engaged in physical and mental challenges, with the winner receiving "$10,000 worth of prizes."[41][42]
Nate eventually comes to his senses and finds Sully alive.

It comes with a Nathan Drake Statue from Sideshow Collectibles, a replica of Drake's belt buckle, a replica of Drake's ring/necklace, a "Steelbook" case packaging with exclusive artwork.
A larger game typically translates into mo-cap and art assets, high-res textures, music, voice audio, more environments, more content, and as a result a more fulfilling game to play.
 "I don't know what the manufacturing costs are, I don't know what the shipping costs are.
It's hard to explain how it works and how we developed it, but it absolutely ended up real and believable.
Eventually we fall into a grand chamber whose skylight is fully submerged. The art deco decor, underwater lighting, and skewed angles recall both Bioshock and The Poseidon Adventure.
In UK, to coincide with the game's launch, GameStop exclusively sold the 320GB 'Classic White' PlayStation 3 system in stores across Ireland and the UK, since GameStop obtained the exclusive right to sell the console on September 9, 2011.
The map, which is similar in style to the "Block Mesh Lab" map, is a "smaller map with two main bases, close quarters and some prime sniper towers".
Instead of including the "Steelbook" case packaging from the Collector's Edition, the Explorer Edition includes the Special Edition and its DLC, as well as all the pre-order bonuses.
The limited edition controller features a two-tone color scheme, with a map design and a smattering of mountains and coastlines sketched across the control pad.
Nathan "Nate" Drake (Nolan North) and Victor "Sully" Sullivan (Richard McGonagle) enter a pub in London to meet with a man named Talbot (Robin Atkin Downes), who is interested in purchasing Nate's ring belonging to his ancestor Sir Francis Drake.
The buddy's emblem remains displayed as part of the player's HUD to indicate their location relative to the player's own on the map.
If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is.
Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is an action-adventure platform video game played from a third-person perspective, with the player in control of Nathan Drake.

The Doppler effect (or Doppler shift), named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who proposed it in 1842 in Prague, is the change in frequency of a wave (or other periodic event) for an observer moving relative to its source.
c + c f0 = 0.5 f0 .
These can be generalized into the equation that was presented in the previous section.
f = \left ( \frac {c+v_\text{r}}{c + v_\text{s}} \right ) f_0

f0 = 3.33 f0 and an observer behind the source will hear a lower frequency
Medical imaging and blood flow measurement[edit]
The distance between successive wave fronts is increased, so the waves "spread out". For waves that propagate in a medium, such as sound waves, the velocity of the observer and of the source are relative to the medium in which the waves are transmitted.
Although "Doppler" has become synonymous with "velocity measurement" in medical imaging, in many cases it is not the frequency shift (Doppler shift) of the received signal that is measured, but the phase shift (when the received signal arrives).
It has been used to measure the speed at which stars and galaxies are approaching or receding from us, that is, the radial velocity.
Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.[citation needed]
As a submarine passes by a passive sonobuoy, the stable frequencies undergo a Doppler shift, and the speed and range from the sonobuoy can be calculated.
When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt.
With an observer stationary relative to the medium, if a moving source is emitting waves with an actual frequency f_\text{0} (in this case, the wavelength is changed, the transmission velocity of the wave keeps constant \text{--} note that the transmission velocity of the wave does not depend on the velocity of the source), then the observer detects waves with a frequency f given by
Scientists[who?] have speculated, since 1943, about the possibility of an inverse Doppler effect.
Velocity measurement of blood flow in arteries and veins based on Doppler effect is an effective tool for diagnosis of vascular problems like stenosis.[7]

Instruments such as the laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV), and acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) have been developed to measure velocities in a fluid flow.
f = c - 0 /
The laser beam from the LDV is directed at the surface of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.
If the sonar system is mounted on a moving ship or another submarine, then the relative velocity can be calculated.
f = \left ( \frac {c}{c + v_\text{s}} \right ) f_0

The siren on a passing emergency vehicle will start out higher than its stationary pitch, slide down as it passes, and continue lower than its stationary pitch as it recedes from the observer.
f = c - 0 /
 "The reason the siren slides is because it doesn't hit you."
v_\text{radial}=v_\text{s}\cdot \cos{\theta}
f0 = -2.5 f0 and an observer behind the source will hear a lower frequency
So it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected.
The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier, and is traveling at 1.4 c (Mach 1.4).
As a result, the wave-fronts begin to bunch up on the right side (in front of) and spread further apart on the left side (behind) of the source.
f0 = ∞ and an observer behind the source will hear a lower frequency
Due to the thermal motion of the emitters, the light emitted by each particle can be slightly red- or blue-shifted, and the net effect is a broadening of the line.
Another use of the Doppler effect, which is found mostly in plasma physics and astronomy, is the estimation of the temperature of a gas (or ion temperature in a plasma) which is emitting a spectral line.
In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the moving car as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength.
This technique allows non-intrusive flow measurements, at high precision and high frequency.
The above formula assumes that the source is either directly approaching or receding from the observer.
\Delta v = v_\text{r} - v_\text{s} \, is the velocity of the receiver relative to the source: it is positive when the source and the receiver are moving towards each other.
f = \left( \frac{c + v_\text{r}}{c + v_\text{s}} \right) f_0 \,
Because the vehicle passes by the observer, the radial velocity does not remain constant, but instead varies as a function of the angle between his line of sight and the siren's velocity:
In other words, if the siren approached the observer directly, the pitch would remain constant until the vehicle hit him, and then immediately jump to a new lower pitch.
c + 0.7c
This is used to detect if an apparently single star is, in reality, a close binary and even to measure the rotational speed of stars and galaxies.
Someone throws one ball every second in a man's direction. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity.
Development[edit]
The sound source will pass by a stationary observer before the observer hears the sound. As a result, an observer in front of the source will detect
Velocity measurements allow assessment of cardiac valve areas and function, any abnormal communications between the left and right side of the heart, any leaking of blood through the valves (valvular regurgitation), and calculation of the cardiac output.
The actual flow is computed as a function of the water velocity and phase.
A similar analysis for a moving observer and a stationary source (in this case, the wavelength keeps constant, but due to the motion, the rate at which the observer receives waves \text{--} and hence the transmission velocity of the wave [with respect to the observer] \text{--} is changed) yields the observed frequency:
However, now the sound source is moving with a speed υs = 0.7 c (Mach 0.7). Since the source is moving, the centre of each new wavefront is now slightly displaced to the right.
v_\text{s} \, is the velocity of the source relative to the medium; positive if the source is moving away from the receiver (and negative in the other direction).
In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity taking into account wind speed and direction relative to the car.
Developed originally for velocity measurements in medical applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (UDV) can measure in real time complete velocity profile in almost any liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions.
As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength.
This technique is fully non-invasive. Satellite communication[edit]
This line shape is called a Doppler profile and the width of the line is proportional to the square root of the temperature of the emitting species, allowing a spectral line (with the width dominated by the Doppler broadening) to be used to infer the temperature.
Hippolyte Fizeau discovered independently the same phenomenon on electromagnetic waves in 1848 (in France, the effect is sometimes called "effet Doppler-Fizeau" but that name was not adopted by the rest of the world as Fizeau's discovery was six years after Doppler's proposal).[3] In Britain, John Scott Russell made an experimental study of the Doppler effect (1848).[4] General[edit]
All observers will hear the same frequency, which will be equal to the actual frequency of the source where f = f0 .
v_\text{r} \, is the velocity of the receiver relative to the medium; positive if the receiver is moving towards the source (and negative in the other direction);
Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source.
Velocity measurements of blood flow are also used in other fields of medical ultrasonography, such as obstetric ultrasonography and neurology.
The inverse is true if the thrower is moving away from the man.

Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient.
Fast moving satellites can have a Doppler shift of dozens of kilohertz relative to a ground station.
An experiment that claimed to have detected this effect was conducted by Nigel Seddon and Trevor Bearpark in Bristol, United Kingdom in 2003.[9] Researchers from Swinburne University of Technology and the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology showed that this effect can be observed in optical frequencies as well.
In classical physics, where the speeds of source and the receiver relative to the medium are lower than the velocity of waves in the medium, the relationship between observed frequency f and emitted frequency f_\text{0} is given by:[5]
Astronomer John Dobson explained the effect thus:
An observer in front of the source will hear a higher frequency
Inverse Doppler effect[edit]
To understand what happens, consider the following analogy.
The Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves such as light is of great use in astronomy and results in either a so-called redshift or blueshift.
Note that in the ball analogy, the speed of the balls is dependent on the speeds of the thrower and receiver which is not the case of the wavefront velocity which remains constant.
It may also be said that the velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.
f = c - 0 / c + 1.4c
If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound using gas-filled microbubble contrast media can be used to improve velocity or other flow-related medical measurements.
Doppler first proposed this effect in 1842 in his treatise "Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels" (On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens).[1] The hypothesis was tested for sound waves by Buys Ballot in 1845.[2] He confirmed that the sound's pitch was higher than the emitted frequency when the sound source approached him, and lower than the emitted frequency when the sound source receded from him.
This was made possible by growing a photonic crystal and projecting a laser beam into the crystal. This made the crystal act like a super prism and the Inverse Doppler Effect could be observed.[10]
One of the limitations is that the ultrasound beam should be as parallel to the blood flow as possible.
When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.
Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed multiple times during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant frequency signal.[8]

Now the source is moving at the speed of sound in the medium (υs = c, or Mach 1).
f = c + 0
The distance between wave-fronts is the wavelength.
f0 = 0.42 f0 . Analysis[edit]
Since blue light has a higher frequency than red light, the spectral lines of an approaching astronomical light source exhibit a blueshift and those of a receding astronomical light source exhibit a redshift.
f = c + 0 / c - c
A radar beam is fired at a moving target — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source.
An echocardiogram can, within certain limits, produce an accurate assessment of the direction of blood flow and the velocity of blood and cardiac tissue at any arbitrary point using the Doppler effect.
Each of these effects is analyzed separately. For waves which do not require a medium, such as light or gravity in general relativity, only the relative difference in velocity between the observer and the source needs to be considered.
The Doppler effect is recognizable in the fact that the absorption lines are not always at the frequencies that are obtained from the spectrum of a stationary light source.
Since the source is moving faster than the sound waves it creates, it actually leads the advancing wavefront.

The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature.
Among the nearby stars, the largest radial velocities with respect to the Sun are +308 km/s (BD-15°4041, also known as LHS 52, 81.7 light-years away) and -260 km/s (Woolley 9722, also known as Wolf 1106 and LHS 64, 78.2 light-years away).
They exhibit absorption lines at well defined frequencies that are correlated with the energies required to excite electrons in various elements from one level to another.
The frequency is decreased if either is moving away from the other.
However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out.
An interesting effect was predicted by Lord Rayleigh in his classic book on sound: if the source is moving at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but backwards.[6]
The Doppler effect is used in some types of radar, to measure the velocity of detected objects.
The frequency of the sounds that the source emits does not actually change.
If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard is higher than the object's emitted frequency.
Astronomy[edit]
Audio[edit] The Leslie speaker, associated with and predominantly used with the Hammond B-3 organ, takes advantage of the Doppler Effect by using an electric motor to rotate an acoustic horn around a loudspeaker, sending its sound in a circle.
where \theta is the angle between the object's forward velocity and the line of sight from the object to the observer.
where c \; is the velocity of waves in the medium;
The LDV emits a light beam and the ADV emits an ultrasonic acoustic burst, and measure the Doppler shift in wavelengths of reflections from particles moving with the flow.
Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when it is coming from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer.
Vibration measurement[edit] A laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is a non-contact method for measuring vibration.
This results at the listener's ear in rapidly fluctuating frequencies of a keyboard note.
[show]Proof Stationary sound source produces sound waves at a constant frequency f, and the wave-fronts propagate symmetrically away from the source at a constant speed c.
The use of the Doppler effect for light in astronomy depends on our knowledge that the spectra of stars are not homogeneous.
The wave fronts in front of the source are now all bunched up at the same point.
As a result, an observer in front of the source will detect nothing until the source arrives where

Helicobacter pylori (/ˌhɛlɪkɵˈbæktər paɪˈlɔəraɪ/; H. pylori), previously named Campylobacter pylori, is a Gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found in the stomach.
1 Signs and symptoms
It does this by producing large amounts of urease, which breaks down the urea present in the stomach to carbon dioxide and ammonia.
10 Evolution
11 History
2 Microbiology
The ammonia, which is basic, then neutralizes stomach acid.

3 Pathophysiology
Inflammation, gastritis, and ulcer[edit]
3.1 Adaptation to the stomach’s acidic environment
Adaptation to the stomach’s acidic environment[edit]
However, over 80 percent of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic and it has been postulated that it may play an important role in the natural stomach ecology.[1]
3.4 Cancer 4 Diagnosis
5 Prevention
The inflammatory response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces G cells in the antrum to secrete the hormone gastrin, which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus.[34] Gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen, and over time increases the number of parietal cells as well.[35] The increased acid load damages the duodenum, which may eventually result in ulcers forming in the duodenum.
6 Treatment
7 Prognosis
It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer.
8 Survival of H. pylori depends on transformation and recombinational DNA repair
Helicobacter cysteine-rich proteins (Hcp), particularly HcpA (hp0211), are known to trigger an immune response, causing inflammation.[31] Chronic gastritis is likely to underlie H. pylori-related diseases.[32]
9 Epidemiology
The cagA gene codes for one of the major H. pylori virulence proteins.
Survival of H. pylori depends on transformation and recombinational DNA repair[edit]
The O antigen of LPS may be fucosylated and mimic Lewis blood group antigens found on the gastric epithelium.[8] The outer membrane also contains cholesterol glucosides, which are found in few other bacteria.[8] H. pylori has four to six lophotrichous flagella; all gastric and enterohepatic Helicobacter species are highly motile owing to flagella.[15] The characteristic sheathed flagellar filaments of Helicobacter are composed of two copolymerized flagellins, FlaA and FlaB.[16]
Two related mechanisms by which H. pylori could promote cancer are under investigation.
It is microaerophilic; that is, it requires oxygen, but at lower concentration than is found in the atmosphere.
When 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and other research showed in 1989 that the bacterium did not belong in the genus Campylobacter, it was placed in its own genus, Helicobacter.
Treatment[edit]
Previously, the only option was symptom control using antacids, H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors alone.[55][56]
In particular, natural transformation is increased by DNA damage in H. pylori, and Dorer et al.[73] found a connection between the DNA damage response and DNA uptake in H. pylori, suggesting that natural competence contributes to persistence of H. pylori in its human host and explains the retention of competence in most clinical isolates.
Once H. pylori is detected in a person with a peptic ulcer, the normal procedure is to eradicate it and allow the ulcer to heal.
H. pylori possesses five major outer membrane protein (OMP) families.[8] The largest family includes known and putative adhesins.
It was identified in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, who found that it was present in patients with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions that were not previously believed to have a microbial cause.
Up to 85% of people infected with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications.[4] Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or nausea.[5] Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, bloating, belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.[6][7]
The precursors of these prototypes have been named ancestral Europe1, ancestral Europe2, ancestral East Asia, ancestral Africa1, ancestral Africa2 and ancestral Sahul.
Scanning electron micrograph of H. pylori
This pathogenicity island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from humans who are carriers of H. pylori but remain asymptomatic.[22]
In the absence of treatment, H. pylori infection—once established in its gastric niche—is widely believed to persist for life.[3] In the elderly, however, it is likely infection can disappear as the stomach's mucosa becomes increasingly atrophic and inhospitable to colonization.
H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by:
Helicobacter pylori was first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and stomach ulcers in 1982 by Dr. Barry Marshall and Dr. Robin Warren of Perth, Western Australia.
Two of sequenced strains have an approximately 40-kb-long Cag pathogenicity island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes.
In addition to using chemotaxis to avoid areas of low pH, H. pylori also neutralizes the acid in its environment.
Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity.
Approximately 10–20% of those colonized by H. pylori will ultimately develop gastric and duodenal ulcers.[8] H. pylori infection is also associated with a 1–2% lifetime risk of stomach cancer and a less than 1% risk of gastric MALT lymphoma.[8]
Genome[edit]
Phase-contrast microscopy
Despite high rates of infection in certain areas of the world, the overall frequency of H. pylori infection is declining.[79] However, antibiotic resistance is appearing in H. pylori; there are already many metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistant strains in most parts of the world.[80]
Recent research states that genetic diversity in H. pylori increases with geographic distance from East Africa, the birthplace of modern humans.
To avoid the acidic environment of the interior of the stomach (lumen), H. pylori uses its flagella to burrow into the mucus lining the stomach to reach the epithelial cells underneath, where there is a more neutral pH.[24] H. pylori is able to sense the pH gradient in the mucus and move towards the less acidic region (chemotaxis).
Previous to the research of Marshall and Warren, German scientists found spiral-shaped bacteria in the lining of the human stomach in 1875, but they were unable to culture it, and the results were eventually forgotten.[64] The Italian researcher Giulio Bizzozero described similarly shaped bacteria living in the acidic environment of the stomach of dogs in 1893.[87] Professor Walery Jaworski of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków investigated sediments of gastric washings obtained from humans in 1899.
The other proposed mechanism has been called a "perigenetic pathway",[41] and involves enhancement of the transformed host cell phenotype by means of alterations in cell proteins, such as adhesion proteins.
Approximately 29% of the loci are in the "pathogenesis" category of the genome database.
Pathophysiology[edit]
Acridine-orange stain, and
H. pylori mutants that are defective in ruvC have increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and to oxidative stress, exhibit reduced survival within macrophages, and are unable to establish successful infection in a mouse model.[74] Similarly, RecN protein plays an important role in DSB repair in H. pylori.[75] An H. pylori recN mutant displays an attenuated ability to colonize mouse stomachs, highlighting the importance of recombinational DNA repair in survival of H. pylori within its host.[75]
The pathogenicity of H. pylori may be increased by genes of the cag pathogenicity island.
Prognosis[edit]
Helicobacter pylori migrated out of Africa along with its human host circa 60,000 years ago.[84] Its subsequent evolution created seven prototypes—Europe (isolated from Europe, the Middle East, India and Iran), NE Africa (from Northeast Africa), Africa1 (from countries in Western Africa and South Africa), Africa2 (from South Africa), Asia2 (from Northern India and among isolates from Bangladesh, Thailand and Malaysia), Sahul (from Australian Aboriginals and Papua New Guineans) and East Asia with the subpopulations E Asia (from East Asians), Maori (from Taiwanese Aboriginals, Melanesians and Polynesians) and Amerind (Native Americans).
It contains a hydrogenase which can be used to obtain energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen (H2) produced by intestinal bacteria.[12] It produces oxidase, catalase, and urease.

Epidemiology[edit]
Signs and symptoms[edit]
These ancestral prototypes appear to have originated in Africa, Central and East Asia.
These results suggested H. pylori was the causative agent of gastritis.
H. pylori colonizes the stomach and induces chronic gastritis, a long-lasting inflammation of the stomach.
While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions, such as starvation, H. pylori is competent throughout logarithmic growth.[73] As pointed out by Dorer et al.,[73] all organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage.
As summarized in Transformation (genetics), transformation (the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium) appears to be part of an adaptation for DNA repair.
Microbiology[edit]
One mechanism involves the enhanced production of free radicals near H. pylori and an increased rate of host cell mutation.
H. pylori is contagious, although the exact route of transmission is not known.[81][82] Person-to-person transmission by either the oral-oral or fecal-oral route is most likely.
Infection is more prevalent in developing countries, and incidence is decreasing in Western countries.
CagA then allosterically activates protein tyrosine phosphatase/protooncogene Shp2.[40] Pathogenic strains of H. pylori have been shown to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a membrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain.
The standard first-line therapy is a one week "triple therapy" consisting of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the antibiotics clarithromycin and amoxicillin.[53] Variations of the triple therapy have been developed over the years, such as using a different proton pump inhibitor, as with pantoprazole or rabeprazole, or replacing amoxicillin with metronidazole for people who are allergic to penicillin.[54] Such a therapy has revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcers and has made a cure to the disease possible.
The pathogenesis of H. pylori depends on its ability to survive in the harsh gastric environment characterized by acidity, peristalsis, and attack by phagocytes accompanied by release of reactive oxygen species.[70] In particular, H. pylori elicits an oxidative stress response during host colonization.
Mounting evidence suggests that H. pylori has an important role in protecting from some diseases.
Most individuals infected by H. pylori will never experience clinical symptoms despite having chronic gastritis.
Cancer[edit]

The location of colonization of H. pylori, which affects the location of the ulcer, depends on the acidity of the stomach.[33] In people producing large amounts of acid, H. pylori colonizes near the pyloric antrum (exit to the duodenum) to avoid the acid-secreting parietal cells at the fundus (near the entrance to the stomach).[8] In people producing normal or reduced amounts of acid, H. pylori can also colonize the rest of the stomach.
One such adhesin is BabA, which binds to the Lewis b antigen displayed on the surface of stomach epithelial cells.[27] Another such adhesin is SabA, which binds to increased levels of sialyl-Lewis x antigen expressed on gastric mucosa.[28]
History[edit]

None of the test methods is completely failsafe.
H. pylori is a helix-shaped (classified as a curved rod, not spirochaete) Gram-negative bacterium about 3 micrometres long with a diameter of about 0.5 micrometres.
This oxidative stress response induces potentially lethal and mutagenic oxidative DNA adducts in the H. pylori genome.[71]
It is capable of forming biofilms[13] and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form,[14] both likely to favor its survival and be factors in the epidemiology of the bacterium.
The AddAB helicase-nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single strand DNA (ssDNA), which then mediates strand exchange, leading to homologous recombination and repair.
Although there was some skepticism initially, within several years numerous research groups verified the association of H. pylori with gastritis and, to a lesser extent, ulcers.[93] To demonstrate H. pylori caused gastritis and was not merely a bystander, Marshall drank a beaker of H. pylori culture.
The genus derived from the ancient Greek hělix/έλιξ "spiral" or "coil".[96] The specific epithet pylōri means "of the pylorus" or pyloric valve (the circular opening leading from the stomach into the duodenum), from the Ancient Greek word πυλωρός, which means gatekeeper.[96]
More than 50% of the world's population harbor H. pylori in their upper gastrointestinal tract.
Diagram showing how the h.pylori reaches the epithelium of the stomach.
At the time, the conventional thinking was that no bacterium can live in the human stomach, as the stomach produced extensive amounts of acid of a strength similar to the acid found in a car battery.
Haematoxylin-eosin stain
After numerous unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach, they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982, when they unintentionally left their Petri dishes incubating for 5 days over the Easter weekend.
He became ill with nausea and vomiting several days later.
In recognition of their discovery, they were awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[86]
In their original paper, Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by infection by this bacterium and not by stress or spicy food, as had been assumed before.[92]
Marshall and Warren rewrote the textbooks with reference to what causes gastritis and gastric ulcers.
H. pylori is a major cause of certain diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
(Marshall et al. 1985) Goodwin et al., 1989
Colonization with H. pylori is not a disease in and of itself but a condition associated with a number of disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract.[8] Testing for H. pylori is recommended if there is peptic ulcer disease, low grade gastric MALT lymphoma, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, if there are first degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia,[43] not routinely.[8] Several ways of testing exist.
Family: Helicobacteraceae Genus: Helicobacter Species: H. pylori Binomial name Helicobacter pylori
European and African strains were introduced into the Americas along with its colonisation—both thousands of years ago and more recently— the slave trade.
In developed nations it is currently uncommon to find infected children, but the percentage of infected people increases with age, with about 50% infected for those over the age of 60 compared with around 10% between 18 and 30 years.[76] The higher prevalence among the elderly reflects higher infection rates when they were children rather than infection at later ages.[8] In the United States, prevalence appears to be higher in African-American and Hispanic populations, most likely due to socioeconomic factors.[77][78] The lower rate of infection in the West is largely attributed to higher hygiene standards and widespread use of antibiotics.
Like other typical Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane of H. pylori consists of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
It has also been suggested that a C-terminal region of the CagA protein (amino acids 873–1002) can regulate host cell gene transcription, independent of protein tyrosine phosphorylation.[22][23] There is a great deal of diversity between strains of H. pylori, and the strain with which one is infected is predictive of the outcome.
H. pylori harms the stomach and duodenal linings by several mechanisms.
In H. pylori, homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs).
Using the genetic diversity data, the researchers have created simulations that indicate the bacteria seem to have spread from East Africa around 58,000 years ago.
This results in initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate.[43][57][58] For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, the use of levofloxacin as part of the therapy has been suggested.[59][60]
The other four families are porins, iron transporters, flagellum-associated proteins, and proteins of unknown function.
Acquisition at an older age brings different gastric changes more likely to lead to duodenal ulcer.[3] Infections are usually acquired in early childhood in all countries.[8] However, the infection rate of children in developing nations is higher than in industrialized nations, probably due to poor sanitary conditions, perhaps combined with lower antibiotics usage for unrelated pathologies.
Evolution[edit]
Microscopy[edit]
Diagnosis[edit]
As reviewed by Michod et al.,[72] vulnerability to oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage occurs commonly in many studied bacterial pathogens including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori.
About 50–70% of H. pylori strains in Western countries carry the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI).[37] Western patients infected with strains carrying the cag PAI have a stronger inflammatory response in the stomach and are at a greater risk of developing peptic ulcers or stomach cancer than those infected with strains lacking the island.[8] Following attachment of H. pylori to stomach epithelial cells, the type IV secretion system expressed by the cag PAI "injects" the inflammation-inducing agent, peptidoglycan, from their own cell wall into the epithelial cells.
When H. pylori colonizes other areas of the stomach, the inflammatory response can result in atrophy of the stomach lining and eventually ulcers in the stomach.
The Cag pathogenicity island[edit]
Warthin-Starry silver stain
H. pylori is found in the mucus, on the inner surface of the epithelium, and occasionally inside the epithelial cells themselves.[26] It adheres to the epithelial cells by producing adhesins, which bind to lipids and carbohydrates in the epithelial cell membrane.
This also may increase the risk of stomach cancer.[36]
Class: Epsilonproteobacteria Order: Campylobacterales
The type IV secretion apparatus also injects the cag PAI-encoded protein CagA into the stomach's epithelial cells, where it disrupts the cytoskeleton, adherence to adjacent cells, intracellular signaling, cell polarity, and other cellular activities.[39] Once inside the cell, the CagA protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by a host cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (TK).
The two sequenced strains show large genetic differences, with up to 6% of the nucleotides differing.[19]
This work was included in the Handbook of Gastric Diseases, but it had little impact, as it was written in Polish.[88] Several small studies conducted in the early 20th century demonstrated the presence of curved rods in the stomach of many patients with peptic ulcers and stomach cancer.[89] Interest in the bacteria waned, however, when an American study published in 1954 failed to observe the bacteria in 1180 stomach biopsies.[90]
Contents [hide]
Prevention[edit]
Consistent with these transmission routes, the bacteria have been isolated from feces, saliva and dental plaque of some infected people.
He was the first to suggest a possible role of this organism in the pathogenesis of gastric diseases.
An endoscopy ten days after inoculation revealed signs of gastritis and the presence of H. pylori.
Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests.[44]
An article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found evidence that "ingesting lactic acid bacteria exerts a suppressive effect on Helicobacter pylori infection in both animals and humans," noting that "supplementing with Lactobacillus-and-Bifidobacterium-containing yogurt (AB-yogurt) was shown to improve the rates of eradication of H. pylori in humans."[61]
Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy.
The proportion of acute infections that persist is not known, but several studies that followed the natural history in populations have reported apparent spontaneous elimination.[62][63]
The bacterium persists in the stomach for decades in most people.
H. pylori is naturally competent for transformation.
Further information: Helicobacter pylori eradication protocols
The low GC-content of the cag PAI relative to the rest of the Helicobacter genome suggests the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species.[17]
Bacterial strains that have the cagA gene are associated with an ability to cause ulcers.[23] The cagA gene codes for a relatively long (1186 amino acid) protein.
In 1987, the Sydney gastroenterologist Thomas Borody invented the first triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcers.[94] In 1994, the National Institutes of Health (USA) published an opinion stating most recurrent duodenal and gastric ulcers were caused by H. pylori, and recommended antibiotics be included in the treatment regimen.[95]
The cag pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system.
Gram stain Giemsa stain
This also keeps the bacteria from being swept away into the lumen with the bacteria’s mucus environment, which is constantly moving from its site of creation at the epithelium to its dissolution at the lumen interface.[25]
H. pylori's helix shape (from which the generic name is derived) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach.[2][3]
Thus, transformation and recombinational repair appear to contribute to successful infection.
Individuals infected with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer.[8] Inflammation of the pyloric antrum is more likely to lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma.[9] However, it is possible that H. pylori plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis.[3] A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded that the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting that the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers - in terms of absolute risk the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.[10]
Helicobacter pylori Scientific classification
Ulcers in the stomach and duodenum result when the consequences of inflammation allow stomach acid and the digestive enzyme pepsin to overwhelm the mechanisms that protect the stomach and duodenal mucous membranes.
Findings suggest that H. pylori is more easily transmitted via gastric mucus than via saliva[3] Transmission occurs mainly within families in developed nations yet can also be acquired from the community in developing countries.[83] H. pylori may also be transmitted orally by means of fecal matter through the ingestion of waste-tainted water, so a hygienic environment could help decrease the risk of H. pylori infection.[3]
Some studies suggest that the presence of bacterias in the stomach may be beneficial, reducing the prevalence of asthma,[50] rhinitis,[50] dermatitis,[50] inflammatory bowel disease,[50] gastroesophageal reflux disease[51] and esophageal cancer[51] by influencing systemic immune responses.[50][52] There is however no evidence that H. Pylori is one of these subject bacterias.
Their results indicate modern humans were already infected by H. pylori before their migrations out of Africa, and it has remained associated with human hosts since that time.[85]
One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood antibody test, stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath).[43] However, the most reliable method for detecting H. pylori infection is a biopsy check during endoscopy with a rapid urease test, histological examination, and microbial culture.[need quotation to verify] There is also a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity.
For each of these pathogens, surviving the DNA damage induced by oxidative stress appears to be supported by transformation-mediated recombinational repair.
Study of the H. pylori genome is centered on attempts to understand pathogenesis, the ability of this organism to cause disease.
Among some rod-like bacteria, he also found bacteria with a characteristic spiral shape, which he called Vibrio rugula.
According to the proposed perigenetic mechanism, inflammation-associated signaling molecules, such as TNF-α, can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to the dispersion and migration of mutated epithelial cells without the need for additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as genes that code for cell adhesion proteins.[42]
Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis.
Interest in understanding the role of bacteria in stomach diseases was rekindled in the 1970s, with the visualization of bacteria in the stomach of gastric ulcer patients.[91] The bacterium had also been observed in 1979, by Australian pathologist Robin Warren, who did further research on it with Australian physician Barry Marshall beginning in 1981.
Marshall and Warren went on to demonstrate that antibiotics are effective in the treatment of many cases of gastritis.
H. pylori consists of a large diversity of strains, and the genomes of three have been completely sequenced.[17][18][19][20][21] The genome of the strain "26695" consists of about 1.7 million base pairs, with some 1,550 genes.
The injected peptidoglycan is recognized by the cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor (immune sensor) Nod1, which then stimulates expression of cytokines that promote inflammation.[38]
Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori can result in chronic gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining, at the site of infection.
At least half the world's population are infected by the bacterium, making it the most widespread infection in the world.[76] Actual infection rates vary from nation to nation; the developing world has much higher infection rates than the West (Western Europe, North America, Australasia), where rates are estimated to be around 25%.[76] The age at which this bacterium is acquired seems to influence the possible pathologic outcome of the infection : people infected with it at an early age are likely to develop more intense inflammation that may be followed by atrophic gastritis with a higher subsequent risk of gastric ulcer, gastric cancer or both.
Rising antibiotic resistance increases the need to search for new therapeutic strategies; this might include prevention in form of vaccination.[45] Much work has been done on developing viable vaccines aimed at providing an alternative strategy to control H. pylori infection and related diseases, including stomach cancer.[46] Researchers are studying different adjuvants, antigens, and routes of immunization to ascertain the most appropriate system of immune protection; however, most of the research only recently moved from animal to human trials.[47] An economic evaluation of the use of a potential H. pylori vaccine in babies found that its introduction could, at least in the Netherlands, prove cost-effective for the prevention of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer.[48] A similar approach has also been studied for the United States.[49]
H. pylori has also been associated with colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer.[11]
The ammonia produced to regulate pH is toxic to epithelial cells, as are biochemicals produced by H. pylori such as proteases, vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) [this damages epithelial cells, disrupts tight junctions and causes apoptosis], and certain phospholipases.[29] Cytotoxin Associated gene [CagA] can also cause inflammation and is potentially a carcinogen.[30]
H. pylori has been proposed to induce inflammation and locally high levels of TNF-α and/or interleukin 6 (IL-6).
Domain: Bacteria Phylum: Proteobacteria
RuvC protein is essential to the process of recombinational repair since it resolves intermediates in this process termed Holliday junctions.
The requirement of RecA plus AddAB for efficient gastric colonization suggests that in the stomach H. pylori is either exposed to double strand DNA damage that must be repaired or requires some other recombination-mediated event.
An increasing number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The bacterium was initially named Campylobacter pyloridis, then renamed C. pylori (pylori being the genitive of pylorus) to correct a Latin grammar error.
THIS IS A TEXT NUMBER 16
The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American mammal of the cat family Felidae, appearing during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO).[3] With 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to northern Mexico, including most of the continental United States.
L. r. gigas (Bangs) – northern New York to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
L. r. escuinipae (J. A. Allen) – central Mexico, with a northern extension along the west coast to southern Sonora
L. r. superiorensis (Peterson & Downing) – western Great Lakes area, including upper Michigan, Wisconsin, southern Ontario, and most of Minnesota
L. r. fasciatus (Rafinesque) – Oregon, Washington west of the Cascade Range, northwestern California, and southwestern British Columbia
Another study observed a similar ratio, and suggested the males may be better able to cope with the increased competition, and this would help limit reproduction until various factors lowered the density.[33]

At birth, it weighs 0.6 to 0.75 lb (270 to 340 g) and is about 10 in (25 cm) in length.
This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations.[66] For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability.
One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67.[54] Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.[33]
One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken.[40] It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest.
Research in Maine has shown little evidence of competitive relationships between the bobcat and coyote or red fox; separation distances and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animals.[41] However, other studies have found bobcat populations may decrease in areas with high coyote populations, with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage.[42] With the Canadian lynx, however, the interspecific relationship affects distribution patterns; competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of its felid relative.[5]
It is an excellent climber, and will swim when it needs to, but will normally avoid water.[14]
There is generally an off-white color on the lips, chin, and underparts.
Physical characteristics[edit]
Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas.
Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and starvation are the other leading causes of death.
Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures.
Unusual for cats, males are more tolerant of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges.[30] Given their smaller range sizes, two or more females may reside within a male's home range.
Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.[70]
Its spotted patterning acts as camouflage.
Sometimes a second litter is born as late as September.
Skull of a bobcat
One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings.[69] However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality.
The tracks can range in size from 1 to 3 in (2.5 to 7.6 cm); the average is about 1.8 inches.[45] When walking or trotting, the tracks are spaced roughly 8 to 18 in (20 to 46 cm) apart.
It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces.
A dominant male will travel with a female and mate with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March.
The adult bobcat has few predators other than humans, although it may be killed in interspecific conflict.
The adult bobcat is 47.5 to 125 cm (18.7 to 49.2 in) long from the head to the base of the tail, averaging 82.7 cm (32.6 in); the stubby tail adds 9 to 20 cm (3.5 to 7.9 in) [12] and its "bobbed" appearance gives the species its name.[15][16][17][18] An adult stands about 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 in) at the shoulders.[10][19] Adult males can range in weight from 6.4 to 18.3 kg (14 to 40 lb), with an average of 9.6 kg (21 lb); females at 4 to 15.3 kg (8.8 to 33.7 lb), with an average of 6.8 kg (15 lb).[20][21] The largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed 22.2 kg (49 lb), although unverified reports have them reaching 27 kg (60 lb).[22] Furthermore, a June 20, 2012 report of a New Hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal's weight at 27 kg (60 lb).[23] The largest-bodied bobcats are from eastern Canada and northern New England of the subspecies (L. r. gigas), while the smallest are from the southeastern subspecies (L. r. floridanus), particularly those in the southern Appalachians.[24] The bobcat is muscular, and its hind legs are longer than its front legs, giving it a bobbing gait.
The face appears wide due to ruffs of extended hair beneath the ears.
Subspecies[edit]
The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area.
Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved.
Like all cats, the bobcat 'directly registers', meaning its hind prints usually fall exactly on top of its fore prints.
Like most felines, the bobcat is largely solitary, but ranges will often overlap.
Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges.
Reports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal.
The bobcat resembles other species of the Lynx genus, but is on average the smallest of the four.
This population evolved into modern bobcats around 20,000 years ago.
The species' range does not seem to be limited by human populations, as long as it can still find a suitable habitat.
It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the domestic cat.
The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures.
When the density decreased, the sex ratio skewed to 0.86 males per female.
For slightly larger animals, such as rabbits and hares, it will stalk from cover and wait until they come within 20 to 35 ft (6.1 to 10.7 m) before rushing in to attack.
Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reportedly observed preying on adult bobcats.[53]
Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.[27]
In its territory, the bobcat will have numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, or under rock ledges.
During lean periods, it will often prey on larger animals it can kill and return to feed on later.
Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her.
When multiple male territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the exclusion of some transients from favored areas.
Kittens may be taken by several predators, including owls, eagles, and foxes, as well as other adult male bobcats; when prey populations are not abundant, fewer kittens are likely to reach adulthood.
Kittens are born well-furred and already have their spots.[10] A few melanistic bobcats have been sighted and captured in Florida.
L. r. baileyi (Merriam) – southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico
L. r. californicus (Mearns) – California west of the Sierra Nevada
L. r. mohavensis (B.Anderson) – Mojave Desert of California
Indirectly, kittens are most vulnerable to hunting given their dependence on an adult female for the first few months of life.
L. r. floridanus (Rafinesque) – southeastern United States and inland to the Mississippi valley, up to southwestern Missouri and southern Illinois
L. r. oaxacensis (Goodwin) – Oaxaca
L. r. pallescens (Merriam) – northwestern United States and southern British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan
L. r. peninsularis (Thomas) – Baja California
L. r. texensis (Mearns) – western Louisiana, Texas, south central Oklahoma, and south into Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, and Coahuila[1][8]
Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats.[55] One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation.[56] One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found only on the bobcat.
The young open their eyes by the ninth or tenth day.
Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques.
The bobcat prey base overlaps with that of other midsized predators of a similar ecological niche.
With small animals, such as rodents (including squirrels), birds, fish, and insects, it will hunt in areas known to be abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand, and wait for victims to wander close.
In the far south, the rabbits and hare are sometimes replaced by cotton rats as the primary food source.
When these prey species exist together, as in New England, they are the primary food sources of the bobcat.

Its preference is for mammals weighing about 1.5 to 12.5 lb (0.68 to 5.67 kg).
Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it will hunt anything from insects, chickens, and small rodents to deer.
Thirteen bobcat subspecies are currently recognized:
The longest they have been known to live is 16 years in the wild and 32 years in captivity.[33]
Comparative illustration of bobcat (top) and Canada lynx (bottom) heads (1906)
Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.[33]
Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils.
By its first birthday, it will reach about 10 lb (4.5 kg).[14]
The bobcat's range does not seem to be limited by human populations, as long as it can find a suitable habitat; only large, intensively cultivated tracts are unsuitable for the species.[25] The animal may appear in back yards in "urban edge" environments, where human development intersects with natural habitats.[57] If chased by a dog, it will usually climb up a tree.[27]
Johnson et al. reported Lynx shared a clade with the puma, leopard cat (Prionailurus), and domestic cat (Felis) lineages, dated to 7.15 million years ago (mya); Lynx diverged first, approximately 3.24 million years ago.[6]
In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999.
Conservation[edit]
In 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly.[64] Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause.

They appear black, but may still exhibit a spot pattern.[11]
The pair may undertake a number of different behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing.
One to six, but usually two to four, kittens are born in April or May, after roughly 60 to 70 days of gestation.
On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.[27]
After trapping the rabbit in a tree, the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire, only to have the embers scattered on its fur, leaving it singed with dark brown spots.[71] The Mohave believed dreaming habitually of beings or objects would afford them their characteristics as supernatural powers.
The bobcat can make great strides when running, often from 4 to 8 ft (1.2 to 2.4 m).[46]
L. rufus rufus (Schreber) – eastern and midwestern United States
Hunting and diet[edit]
The bobcat hunts by stalking its prey and then ambushing it with a short chase or pounce.
Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.[67]
The bobcat population has seen decline in the American Midwest, but is generally stable and healthy
Its population in Canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the Canadian lynx.
The bobcat also suffered population decline in New Jersey at the turn of the 19th century, mainly because of commercial and agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the bobcat was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991.[13] L. r. escuinipae, the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005.[63]
It was removed from the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003.
It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.
As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.[33]
There had been debate over whether to classify this species as Lynx rufus or Felis rufus as part of a wider issue regarding whether the four species of Lynx should be given their own genus, or be placed as a subgenus of Felis.[4][5] The Lynx genus is now accepted, and the bobcat is listed as Lynx rufus in modern taxonomic sources.
Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male will be fertile into the summer.
Cougars and gray wolves will kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park.[48] Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens.[49][50][51] There is at least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass.[52]
The sizes of bobcats' home ranges vary significantly; a World Conservation Union (IUCN) summary of research suggests ranges from 0.02 to 126 sq mi (0.052 to 326.339 km2).[25] One study in Kansas found resident males to have ranges of roughly 8 sq mi (21 km2), and females less than half that area.
Reproduction and life cycle[edit]
The historical range of the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and as far south as the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area.
The bobcat may have external parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and will often carry the parasites of its prey, especially those of rabbits and squirrels.
It will make its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage.[27] The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.[9]
They generally begin breeding by their second summer, though females may start as early as their first year.
Transient bobcats were found to have both larger (roughly 22 sq mi (57 km2)) and less well-defined home ranges.
The cat is larger in its northern range and in open habitats.[25] A morphological size comparison study in the eastern United States found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimens, suggesting differing selection constraints for the sexes.[26]
The bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat.[25] In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.[25]
The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.
Bobcat activities are confined to well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on gender and the distribution of prey.
It has been known to kill deer, especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant.
Bobcats typically live to six or eight years of age, with a few reaching beyond ten.
Bobcats in the desert regions of the southwest have the lightest-colored coats, while those in the northern, forested regions are darkest.

The bobcat is crepuscular.
The bobcat is able to survive for long periods without food, but will eat heavily when prey is abundant.
The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and will wait out heavy storms in sheltered areas;[61] it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently.

The bobcat hunts animals of different sizes, and will adjust its hunting techniques accordingly.
The bobcat is believed to have evolved from the Eurasian lynx, which crossed into North America by way of the Bering Land Bridge during the Pleistocene, with progenitors arriving as early as 2.6 million years ago.[5] The first wave moved into the southern portion of North America, which was soon cut off from the north by glaciers.
In mythology[edit]
A bobcat on the Calero Creek Trail, in San Jose, California
It is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),[62] which means it is not considered threatened with extinction, but hunting and trading must be closely monitored.
The bobcat is an opportunistic predator that, unlike the more specialized Canadian lynx, will readily vary its prey selection.[25] Diet diversification positively correlates to a decline in numbers of the bobcat's principal prey; the abundance of its main prey species is the main determinant of overall diet.[34]
Less commonly, it will feed on larger animals, such as young ungulates and other carnivores such as fishers, foxes, minks, skunks, small dogs and domesticated cats.[27][35][36] Bobcats are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered whooping crane.[37] Bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry.
The female may later go on to mate with other males,[27] and males will generally mate with several females.[43] During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds.[44] Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring.[29] The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days.
The female raises the young alone.
The female generally gives birth in an enclosed space, usually a small cave or hollow log.
Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.[13][43]
Bobcat in urban surroundings.
Within three to five months, they begin to travel with their mother.[44] They will be hunting by themselves by fall of their first year, and usually disperse shortly thereafter.[27] In Michigan, however, they have been observed staying with their mother as late as the next spring.[43]
Dreaming of two deities, cougar and lynx, they thought, would grant them the superior hunting skills of other tribes.[72] European settlers to the Americas also admired the cat, both for its ferocity and its grace, and in the United States, it "rests prominently in the anthology of ... national folklore."[73]
Contents [hide]
The animal is regulated in all three of its range countries, and is found in a number of protected areas of the United States, its principal territory.[25] Estimates from the US Fish and Wildlife Service placed bobcat numbers between 700,000 and 1,500,000 in the US in 1988, with increased range and population density suggesting even greater numbers in subsequent years; for these reasons, the U.S. has petitioned CITES to remove the cat from Appendix II.[9] Populations in Canada and Mexico remain stable and healthy.
It keeps on the move from three hours before sunset until about midnight, and then again from before dawn until three hours after sunrise.
Tracks[edit]
Distribution and habitat[edit]
It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but unlike the other Lynx species, it does not depend exclusively on the deep forest.

Social structure and home range[edit]
This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling.
Bobcat tracks can be generally distinguished from feral or house cat tracks by their larger size: about 2.0 in2 (13 cm²) versus 1.5 in2 (10 cm²).[47]
Bobcat tracks show four toes without claw marks, due to their retractable claws.
It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas.
It will then pounce, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws.
The ears are black-tipped and pointed, with short, black tufts.
The bobcat has long been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but has maintained a high population, even in the southern United States, where it is extensively hunted.
Each night it will move from 2 to 7 mi (3.2 to 11.3 km) along its habitual route.[14] This behavior may vary seasonally, as bobcats become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey, which are more active during the day in colder months.[13]
Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches.
In a Shawnee tale, the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit, which gives rise to its spots.
The elusive predator features in Native American mythology and the folklore of European settlers.
In Native American mythology, the bobcat is often twinned with the figure of the coyote in a theme of duality.[68] Lynx and coyote are associated with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Amerindian folklore.
The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected.
Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges.[65] A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and other developments.
They start exploring their surroundings at four weeks and are weaned at about two months.
In the eastern United States, it is the eastern cottontail species, and in the north it is the snowshoe hare.
According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths.[38] However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals.[39]
The bobcat is an adaptable animal.
Its main prey varies by region.
Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance.
The bobcat is vital for controlling pest populations.
The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edges, and swampland environments.
Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area.
One study found a large variation in male range sizes, from 16 sq mi (41 km2) in summer up to 40 sq mi (100 km2) in winter.[27] Another found that female bobcats, especially those which were reproductively active, expanded their home range in winter, but that males merely shifted their range without expanding it, which was consistent with numerous earlier studies.[30] Other research in various American states has shown little or no seasonal variation.[28][31][32]
With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the mid-sized Lynx genus.
Behavior[edit]
In line with widely differing estimates of home range size, population density figures are divergent, from one to 38 bobcats per 10 sq mi (26 km2) in one survey.[25] The average is estimated at one bobcat per 5 square miles (13 km2).[27] A link has been observed between population density and sex ratio.
Rabbits and hares, along with rodents, are taken most often by the cat
Its coat is variable, though generally tan to grayish-brown, with black streaks on the body and dark bars on the forelegs and tail.
While larger species, such as cattle and horses, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants, such as sheep and goats.
The nose of the bobcat is pinkish-red, and it has a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back.[12] The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception.[13] The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell.
It remains in some of its original range, but local populations are vulnerable to extirpation by coyotes and domestic animals.

Example[edit]
—Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar 56
Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has modern application in the ROT13 system.
In the 19th century, the personal advertisements section in newspapers would sometimes be used to exchange messages encrypted using simple cipher schemes.
Another way of viewing this method is that, under each letter of the ciphertext, the entire alphabet is written out in reverse starting at that letter.
D_n(x) = (x - n) \mod {26}.
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
shift Candidate plaintext
I.e., if x+n or x-n are not in the range 0...25, we have to subtract or add 26.)
For natural language plaintext, there will, in all likelihood, be only one plausible decryption, although for extremely short plaintexts, multiple candidates are possible.
E_n(x) = (x + n) \mod {26}.
Decryption is performed similarly,
Whenever he wrote in cipher, he wrote B for A, C for B, and the rest of the letters on the same principle, using AA for Z. —Suetonius, Life of Augustus 88
The replacement remains the same throughout the message, so the cipher is classed as a type of monoalphabetic substitution, as opposed to polyalphabetic substitution.
While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier.
Another brute force approach is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters.
There is evidence that Julius Caesar used more complicated systems as well,[3] and one writer, Aulus Gellius, refers to a (now lost) treatise on his ciphers:
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
Keywords shorter than the message (e.g., "Complete Victory" used by the Confederacy during the American Civil War), introduce a cyclic pattern that might be detected with a statistically advanced version of frequency analysis.[10]
If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others.
In April 2006, fugitive Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano was captured in Sicily partly because some of his messages, written in a variation of the Caesar cipher, were broken.
Provenzano's cipher used numbers, so that "A" would be written as "4", "B" as "5", and so on.[11]
In the above, the result is in the range 0...25.
A Caesar shift of thirteen is also performed in the ROT13 algorithm, a simple method of obfuscating text widely found on Usenet and used to obscure text (such as joke punchlines and story spoilers), but not seriously used as a method of encryption.[9] The disk with a Caesar cipher A construction of 2 rotating disks with a Caesar cipher can be used to encrypt or decrypt the code.
The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario. Two situations can be considered:
The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.[5]
(There are different definitions for the modulo operation.
By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot the value of the shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph.
For example, the ciphertext MPQY could, plausibly, decrypt to either "aden" or "know" (assuming the plaintext is in English); similarly, "ALIIP" to "dolls" or "wheel"; and "AFCCP" to "jolly" or "cheer" (see also unicity distance).
When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the "plain" line and writes down the corresponding letter in the "cipher" line.
This may be a holdover from an earlier time when Jewish people were not allowed to have mezuzot.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
History and usage[edit]
In 2011, Rajib Karim was convicted in the United Kingdom of "terrorism offences" after using the Caesar cipher to communicate with Bangladeshi Islamic activists discussing plots to blow up British Airways planes or disrupt their IT networks.
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
[12] The animated series Gravity Falls uses the Caesar cipher as one of three different ciphers (the other two being Atbash and an A1Z26 cipher) during the end credits of the first six episodes. Breaking the cipher[edit]
The strips are then aligned to form the ciphertext along one row, and the plaintext should appear in one of the other rows.
This attack can be accelerated using a set of strips prepared with the alphabet written down them in reverse order.
Since there are only a limited number of possible shifts (26 in English), they can each be tested in turn in a brute force attack.[14] One way to do this is to write out a snippet of the ciphertext in a table of all possible shifts[15] – a technique sometimes known as "completing the plain component".[16] The example given is for the ciphertext "EXXEGOEXSRGI"; the plaintext is instantly recognisable by eye at a shift of four.
Decryption
The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions.
His nephew, Augustus, also used the cipher, but with a right shift of one, and it did not wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet:
Contents [hide]
A Caesar shift "rotates" this distribution, and it is possible to determine the shift by examining the resultant frequency graph.
Caesar ciphers can be found today in children's toys such as secret decoder rings.
It is unknown how effective the Caesar cipher was at the time, but it is likely to have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language.[4] There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers.
The Vigenère cipher uses a Caesar cipher with a different shift at each position in the text; the value of the shift is defined using a repeating keyword.
Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
The Caesar cipher is named for Julius Caesar, who used an alphabet with a left shift of three.
There is even a rather ingeniously written treatise by the grammarian Probus concerning the secret meaning of letters in the composition of Caesar's epistles.
For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):
Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.
Plaintext: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
This is because two encryptions of, say, shift A and shift B, will be equivalent to an encryption with shift A + B. In mathematical terms, the encryption under various keys forms a group.[19]
This is known as frequency analysis. For example in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive.[17] Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.[18]
In the second instance, breaking the scheme is even more straightforward.
In the first case, the cipher can be broken using the same techniques as for a general simple substitution cipher, such as frequency analysis or pattern words.[13] While solving, it is likely that an attacker will quickly notice the regularity in the solution and deduce that a Caesar cipher is the specific algorithm employed.
The encryption can also be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1,..., Z = 25.[1] Encryption of a letter x by a shift n can be described mathematically as,[2]
The letters of the cryptogram themselves comprise a religiously significant "divine name" which Orthodox belief holds keeps the forces of evil in check.[6]
If the keyword is as long as the message, chosen random, never becomes known to anyone else, and is never reused, this is the one-time pad cipher, proven unbreakable.
A Caesar cipher with a shift of one is used on the back of the mezuzah to encrypt the names of God.
an attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not specifically that it is a Caesar scheme;
an attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.
Multiple encryptions and decryptions provide no additional security.
As with all single alphabet substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security.
The distribution of letters in a typical sample of English language text has a distinctive and predictable shape.
Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times.[7] Even as late as 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army employed it as a replacement for more complicated ciphers which had proved to be too difficult for their troops to master; German and Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.[8]
The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it with a shift of three to protect messages of military significance.
If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out.

Perseus (/ˈpɜrsiəs/; Greek: Περσεύς), the legendary founder of Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty of Danaans, was the first of the heroes of Greek mythology whose exploits in defeating various archaic monsters provided the founding myths of the Twelve Olympians.

This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the –th– in perthein; that is, the Greeks preferred not to say *pherthein.
Atreus was one generation later, a total of five generations.
J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as *bher-, from which Latin ferio, "strike".[1] This corresponds to Julius Pokorny’s *bher-(3), “scrape, cut.”
Perseus frees Andromeda (detail), by Piero di Cosimo, 1515 (Uffizi)
This mythical Ethiopia was ruled by King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia.
Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne.
It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing.
Zeus gave him an adamantine sword and Hades' helm of darkness to hide.
Renaissance Europe and modern imagery has generated the idea that Perseus flew mounted on Pegasus (though not in the paintings by Piero di Cosimo and Titian).[note 2]
 "Perseus with the Head of Medusa'" is a common subject for sculpture, here in an 1801 example by Antonio Canova
Origin at Argos[edit]
In the classical myth, he flew using the flying sandals.
The Graeae were three perpetually old women, who had to share a single eye.
A statement by the Athenian orator, Isocrates[26] helps to date Perseus roughly.
Herodotus[2] recounts this story, devising a foreign son, Perses, from whom the Persians took the name.
Cassiopeia, having boasted her daughter Andromeda equal in beauty to the Nereids, drew down the vengeance of Poseidon, who sent an inundation on the land and a sea serpent, Cetus, which destroyed man and beast.
The exchange might well have been a creative solution to a difficult problem; however, Megapenthes would have been required to avenge his father, which, in legend, he did, but only at the end of Perseus' long and successful reign.
The replacement of Bellerophon as the tamer and rider of Pegasus by the more familiar culture hero Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the Renaissance.
Athena instructed Perseus to find the Hesperides, who were entrusted with weapons needed to defeat the Gorgon.
Chimera, the 1972 National Book Award-winning novel by John Barth, includes a novella called Perseid that is a retelling of the myth of Perseus.
The movie was loosely based on the first in a series of books written by Rick Riordan.
Pers-eus therefore is a sacker of cities; that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.
In Pausanias[19] he did not return to Argos, but went instead to Larissa, where athletic games were being held.
Perses was left in Aethiopia and became an ancestor of the Persians.
Main article: Perseides
Outside of a comic book adaptation of the 1981 Clash of the Titans film published by Western Publishing[29] and a graphic novel called Perseus: Destiny's Call published in 2012 by Campfire Books,[30] the story of Perseus continued in a couple of comic book series from Bluewater Comics.
This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.
Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern.
On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Danaë, king.
Overcoming the Gorgon[edit]
According to Carl Darling Buck (Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin), the –eus suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, pers-.
Perseus saves Andromeda in this painting by Edward Burne-Jones
The native name, however has always had an -a- in Persian.
Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Electryon, and Cynurus, and two daughters, Gorgophone, and Autochthe.
The first was the 2007 miniseries Wrath of the Titans,[31] (which also spawned a one-shot comic called Wrath of the Titans: Cyclops),[32] while the second is the 2011 miniseries Wrath of the Titans: Revenge of Medusa.[33] Perseus is featured in the video game God of War II, voiced by Harry Hamlin.
Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the oracle at Delphi, who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son with Zeus.
Ordinarily *bh- descends to Greek as ph-.
He states also that Atreus stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why Heinrich Schliemann named the largest tholos tomb the Treasury of Atreus.
Modern uses of the theme and pop culture[edit]
Perseus slew the monster and, setting her free, claimed her in marriage.
In Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, the narrator asserts that Perseus was the first whaleman, when he killed Cetus to save Andromeda.[28] Operatic treatments of the subject include Persée by Lully (1682) and Persée et Andromède by Ibert (1921).
There Teutamides, king of Larissa, was holding funeral games for his father.
There is some prospect that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language.
A Greek folk etymology connected the name of the Persian (Pars) people, whom they called the Persai.
In film, the myth of Perseus was loosely adapted numerous times.
Perseus and Andromeda
[15] Marriage to Andromeda[edit]
Mother and child washed ashore on the island of Serifos, where they were taken in by the fisherman Dictys ("fishing net"), who raised the boy to manhood.
The story is related in Pausanias,[22] which gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to become king of Argos by inflicting death.
Perseus married Andromeda in spite of Phineus, to whom she had before been promised.
In any case, Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda.
The transition was a development of Classical times which became the standard image during the Middle Ages and has been adopted by the European poets of the Renaissance and later: Giovanni Boccaccio's Genealogia deorum gentilium libri (10.27) identifies Pegasus as the steed of Perseus, and Pierre Corneille places Perseus upon Pegasus in Andromède.[27] Modern representations of this image include sculptor Émile Louis Picault's 1888 sculpture, Pegasus.
Having killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to Megapenthes ("great mourning") son of Proetus and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of Tiryns.
The origin of perth- is more obscure.
From here he proceeded to visit Atlas king of Mauritania, who had refused him hospitality; in revenge Perseus turned him to stone.
The oracle of Ammon announced that no relief would be found until the king exposed his daughter Andromeda to the monster, and so she was fastened naked to a rock on the shore.
The other two Gorgons pursued Perseus,[14] but, wearing his helm of darkness, he escaped.
On the way back to Seriphos Island, Perseus stopped in the kingdom of Aethiopia.
Graves carries the meaning still further, to the perse- in Persephone, goddess of death.
Perseus beheaded the Gorgon Medusa, and saved Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus.
He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, Electryon, Alcmena, and Heracles, who was a contemporary of Eurystheus.
From the Hesperides he received a knapsack (kibisis) to safely contain Medusa's head.
Following Athena's guidance,[12] Perseus sought out the Graeae, sisters of the Gorgons, to demand the whereabouts of the Hesperides, the nymphs tending Hera's orchard.
The oracle fulfilled[edit]
Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and impregnated her.[6] Soon after, their child was born; Perseus—"Perseus Eurymedon,[7] for his mother gave him this name as well" (Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica IV).
The second was the 1981 fantasy/adventure film Clash of the Titans, and the third was that film's 2010 remake Clash of the Titans, which was followed by a sequel called Wrath of the Titans in 2012.
He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.[note 1] Polydectes requested that the guests bring horses, under the pretense that he was collecting contributions for the hand of Hippodamia, "tamer of horses".
Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danaë, who by her very name, was the archetype of all the Danaans.[4] Danaë was the daughter of Acrisius, King of Argos.
By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head.
In that regard Robert Graves has espoused the only Greek derivation available.
Fearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.[8] Danaë's fearful prayer, made while afloat in the darkness, has been expressed by the poet Simonides of Ceos.

As the women passed the eye from one to another, Perseus snatched it from them, holding it for ransom in return for the location of the nymphs.[13] When the sisters led him to the Hesperides, he returned what he had taken.
King of Mycenae[edit]
Because of the obscurity of the name Perseus and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists pass it by, on the presumption that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus’ native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives.
Pausanias[23] asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae.
When Perseus was grown, Polydectes came to fall in love with the beautiful Danaë.
Polydectes held Perseus to his rash promise and demanded the head of the only mortal Gorgon,[9] Medusa, whose eyes turned people to stone.
Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; he would not refuse it.
At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of Medusa's head that Perseus had kept.[16] Andromeda ("queen of men") followed her husband to Tiryns in Argos, and became the ancestress of the family of the Perseidae who ruled at Tiryns through her son with Perseus, Perses.[17] After her death she was placed by Athena amongst the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia.[note 3] Sophocles and Euripides (and in more modern times Pierre Corneille) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.
Perseus was also featured in comics.

The fulfillment of the oracle[note 4] was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile.
John Chadwick in the second edition of Documents in Mycenaean Greek speculates as follows about the Mycenaean goddess pe-re-*82, attested on the PY Tn 316 tablet (Linear B: 𐀟𐀩𐁚) and tentatively reconstructed as *Preswa:

Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace.
In 2010 Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief told the story of a demigod named after Perseus; however he is portrayed as a son of Poseidon, rather than Zeus.
The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.
As Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of Libya, according to Apollonius of Rhodes,[18] the falling drops of Medusa's blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut Mopsus.
The first being the 1963 Italian film Perseus The Invincible (which was dubbed and released to the U.S as Medusa Against the Son of Hercules in 1964).
”It is tempting to see...the classical Perse...daughter of Oceanus...; whether it may be further identified with the first element of Persephone is only speculative.”

In order to keep Danaë childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:[5] This mytheme is also connected to Ares, Oenopion, Eurystheus, etc.
Perseus on Pegasus[edit]
Apparently the Persians themselves[3] knew the story, as Xerxes tried to use it to suborn the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.
He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called Persea.
The other descendants ruled Mycenae from Electryon down to Eurystheus, after whom Atreus got the kingdom.
In a third tradition,[21] Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother, Proetus.
From her neck sprang Pegasus ("he who sprang") and Chrysaor ("bow of gold"), the result of Poseidon and Medusa's meeting.

The brother of Dictys was Polydectes ("he who receives/welcomes many"), the king of the island.
The two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus—for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks— are Pausanias and the Bibliotheca, but from them we obtain mainly folk-etymology concerning the founding of Mycenae.
Ovid's account of Medusa's mortality tells that she had once been a woman, vain of her beautiful hair, who had lain with Poseidon in the Temple of Athena.[10] In punishment for the desecration of her temple, Athena had changed Medusa's hair into hideous snakes "that she may alarm her surprised foes with terror".[11]
In the Bibliotheca,[20] the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when he learned of the oracle, went into voluntary exile in Pelasgiotis (Thessaly).
Apart from these more historical references, we have only folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named myces) at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named from the lady Mycene, daughter of Inachus, mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the Megalai Ehoiai.[24] For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus fortified Mycenae according to Apollodorus[25] along with Midea, an action that implies that they both previously existed.
Perseus might be from the Greek verb, "πέρθειν" (perthein), “to waste, ravage, sack, destroy”, some form of which appears in Homeric epithets.
Perseus and the head of Medusa in a Roman fresco at Stabiae
However, the Perseids included the great hero, Heracles, stepson of Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus.
He had just invented the quoit and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled.
In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification.
In the cave he came upon the sleeping Medusa.
Competing in the discus throw Perseus' throw veered and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly.
Descendants[edit]
Hermes lent Perseus winged sandals to fly, while Athena gave him a polished shield.
Perseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a votive gift to Athena, who set it on Zeus' shield (which she carried), as the Gorgoneion (see also: Aegis).
Perseus then proceeded to the Gorgons' cave.

Aggregator Score
As of November 16, 2004, eight million copies of the game had been sold,[10] by 2008 9.3 million copies had been sold at retail.[11] The game has won over 50 Game of the Year awards.[5][6]
Some puzzles involve using the environment to kill an enemy, like turning on a steam valve to spray hot steam at their enemies.
Main articles: Half-Life: Source and Black Mesa (video game) To experience firsthand the processes mod-makers would have to go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine.
Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, Opposing Force, and the new Blue Shift content.
Half-Life has no "levels"; it instead divides the game by chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game.
The original code name for Half-Life was Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King's novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game.[35] Gabe Newell explained that the name Half-Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda), which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation.[16] According to one of the game's designers, Harry Teasley, Doom was a huge influence on most of the team working on Half-Life.
The add-on featured cooperative gameplay in which two players could solve puzzles or fight against the many foes in the Half-Life universe.[52]
The Half-Life SDK was used as a base for the development of many multiplayer mods, including the Valve-developed Team Fortress Classic (TFC) and Deathmatch Classic (DMC).
It has been confirmed that Black Mesa will be distributed via Steam; the remake was among the first ten titles whose release on the platform was approved using Valve's crowdvoting service Steam Greenlight.[66]
Half-Life was ported to the PlayStation 2 by Gearbox Software and released in 2001.[44] This version of the game had a significant overhaul in terms of both character models, weapons, and more advanced and extended levels and general map geometry, incorporated from work on a planned Dreamcast version.
The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the cancelled Dreamcast version.
In 2005, Half-Life 1: Anthology was released, containing Steam-only versions of the following games on a single DVD: Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force, Half-Life: Blue Shift, and Team Fortress Classic.[54]
It introduced several new weapons, new non-player characters, both friendly and hostile and new, previously unseen areas of the facility.
Expansions and sequels[edit]
Expansions[edit]
Entitled Half-Life: Uplink, the demonstration featured many of the weapons and non-player characters in Half-Life.
Blue Shift returns the player to Half-Life's Black Mesa timeline once more, this time as Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards.
In this scene, the player must bypass a dam reservoir guarded by an Apache helicopter, a group of soldiers, and a cannon emplacement.
The plot of the film was that a journalist infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has happened there.[85][86][87][88]
Late in the game, the player receives a "long jump module" for the HEV suit, which allows the player to increase the horizontal distance and speed of jumps by crouching before jumping.
Dr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility.
Two experimental weapons, the tau cannon (nicknamed the Gauss gun) and the Gluon Gun, are built by the scientists in the facility and are acquired by the player late in the game.[13]
He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit.
According to Teasley, they wanted Half-Life to "scare you like Doom did".[36] Newell felt that "Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization of the experience of the first person genre.
GameRankings 94.02% (PC)[67]
The game regularly integrates puzzles, such as navigating a maze of conveyor belts, or using nearby boxes to build a small staircase to the next area the player must travel to.
Freeman becomes one of the survivors of an experiment at Black Mesa that goes horribly wrong, when an unexpected "resonance cascade"—a fictitious phenomenon —rips dimensional seams, devastating the facility.
The iconic weapon of Half-Life is the crowbar.
Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Life's story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping the player in control of the first-person viewpoint.
Aliens from another dimension known as Xen subsequently enter the facility through these dimensional seams (an event known as the "Black Mesa incident").[13]
On its release, the game received universal acclaim, with critics praising the seamlessly flowing narrative, presentation and realistic gameplay, and it won over fifty PC Game of the Year awards.[5][6] Its gameplay influenced the design of first-person shooters for years after its release, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest computer games of all time.[7][8] IGN ranked Half-Life as the number one greatest first-person shooter of all time, stating that "When you look at the history of first-person shooters, it all breaks down pretty cleanly into pre-Half-Life and post-Half-Life eras."[9] Half-Life had sold eight million copies by 16 November 2004,[10] and 9.3 million copies by December 2008.[11] By 14 July 2007, the Half-Life franchise as a whole had sold over 20 million units.[12] Half-Life was followed by the 2004 sequel Half-Life 2, which also received universal critical acclaim.

The player again takes the role of Gordon Freeman, this time 20 years after the Black Mesa incident in the dystopic Eastern European "City 17" where he must fight as part of a rebellion against an alien regime.
The Greek letter lambda, which features prominently on the game's packaging and story, represents the related decay constant, as well as the Lambda Complex featured in the game.
Two expansion packs by outside developer Gearbox Software have been released for the PC version: Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999) and Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001).
Other survivors claim a rescue team has been dispatched, only to discover that the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit sent in is killing both the organisms and the personnel there as part of a government cover-up of the catastrophe.[20]
Half-Life's public reception was overwhelmingly positive in terms of reviews, acclaim and sales.
He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis.
The popularity of the Half-Life series has led way to an array of side products and collectibles.
Half-Life: Decay was another expansion by Gearbox, released only as an extra with the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.
Half-Life: Source has been criticized for not fully utilizing many of the features of the Source engine found in Half-Life 2, as it still uses textures and models from the original game.
Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack.
Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.[57]
The former returns the player to Black Mesa during the events of Half-Life's storyline, but this time from the perspective of Adrian Shephard, one of the Marines in the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit sent to cover up evidence of the incident.
Progress through the world is continuous, except for breaks for loading.[13]

Other mods such as Counter-Strike began life as the work of independent developers (self-termed "modders") who later received aid from Valve.
However, Sierra withdrew it from circulation, after itself and Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film. The critical reception of the film was very poor.
Freeman awakens, stripped of his weapons, to the G-Man, who has been watching over Gordon throughout.
Half-Life was critically acclaimed, earning an overall score of 96 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic.[72] Computer Gaming World's Jeff Green said that the game "is not just one of the best games of the year.
He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen the lab has ever worked with.
Also added in is a head-to-head play and a co-op expansion called Half-Life: Decay that allowed players to play as the two female scientists Dr. Cross and Dr. Green at Black Mesa.
Ports[edit]
Sequels[edit]
Guinness World Records awarded Half-Life with the world record for "Best-Selling First-Person Shooter of All Time (PC)" in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008.
Development[edit]
Our hope was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries."[37]
Around the same time, Half-Life: Blue Shift, which was intended to be the Dreamcast-exclusive side story, was eventually released on Windows as the second Half-life Expansion Pack.[48] It featured the "High Definition Pack", upgraded models originally in the Dreamcast version, which overhauled the graphics of the original Half-Life and Opposing Force as well.
The expansion is shorter than Half-Life, having 11 chapters to the original's 19.[48][51]
Developers fixed the error by adding corrections into a single line of the source code.[42]
Ultimately, Freeman uses the cooperation of surviving scientists and security officers to work his way towards the mysterious "Lambda Complex" of Black Mesa (signified with the Greek "λ" character), where a team of survivors teleport him to the alien world Xen to kill the Nihilanth, the semi-physical entity keeping Xen's side of the dimensional rift open.[13]
Despite calling for reinforcements, the Marines are being overwhelmed by the aliens.[25] Scaling cliffs and navigating destroyed buildings, Gordon reaches safety underground.[25] The Marines begin to pull out of Black Mesa and airstrikes begin.
In a 2003 Making Of... feature in Edge, Newell discusses the team's early difficulties with level design.[40] In desperation, a single level was assembled including every weapon, enemy, scripted event, and level design quirk that the designers had come up with so far.[40] This single level inspired the studio to press on with the game.[40] As a result, the studio completely reworked the game's artificial intelligence and levels in the year leading up to its release.[40] At E3 1998 it was given Game Critics Awards for "Best PC Game" and "Best Action Game".[39] The release date was delayed several times in 1998 before the game was finally released in November of that year.[41] A few days prior to the release in November, the developers discovered an error in the source code.
At the ECTS 2000, a build of the game was playable on the publisher's stand, and developers Randy Pitchford and Brian Martel were in attendance to show it off and give interviews to the press.
Counter-Strike was the most successful, having been released in six different editions: as a standalone product (2000), as part of the Platinum Pack (2000), as an Xbox version (2003), as a single player spin-off called Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (2004), Counter-Strike: Source, which runs on Half-Life 2's Source engine, and the newest addition Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, also running on the Source engine.
There are few "bosses" in the conventional sense, where the player defeats a superior opponent by direct confrontation.
In Half-Life: Decay, the title again references the half-life equation with the lambda symbol being the decay constant.
Name[edit]
Some Half-Life modifications eventually landed on retail shelves.
Gordon escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility where he discovers an extensive collection of specimens collected from Xen, long before the resonance cascade.[24]
He explains that his "employers", believing that Freeman has potential, have authorized him to offer Freeman a job.
Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch.
Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software.
The player must rely on this ability to navigate various platformer-style jumping puzzles in Xen toward the end of the game.[13]
Reception and legacy[edit]
The immersive gaming experience and interactive environment was cited by several reviewers as being revolutionary.[81] Allgame said "It isn't everyday that you come across a game that totally revolutionizes an entire genre, but Half-Life has done just that".[81] Hot Games commented on the realism of the game, and how the environment "all adds up to a totally immersive gaming experience that makes everything else look quite shoddy in comparison".[82] Gamers Depot found the game engaging, stating that they have "yet to play a more immersive game period".[83]
Team Fortress Classic, Day of Defeat and Gunman Chronicles (2000, a futuristic Western movie-style total conversion with emphasis on its single player mode) were also released as stand-alone products.
They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2's Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies.
Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.[60]
No exact release date was given, simply the words "In the coming weeks..." On July 2, 2005 Half-Life Deathmatch: Source was released.[59]
Sierra On-Line eventually signed the game after expressing interest in making a 3D action game.
Should he refuse this offer, he will be given a battle that he has no chance of winning.

The first demo, Half-Life: Day One, contained the first one-fifth of the full game, and was meant only for distribution with certain graphic cards.[43] The second demo was released on February 12, 1999.
The game had its first major public appearance at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo.
Plot[edit] Setting[edit]
Throughout the game, a mysterious figure known (but not actually referred to in-game) as the "G-Man" regularly appears, and seems to be monitoring Freeman's progress.
The first public appearances of Half-Life came in early 1997; it was a hit at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year, where they primarily demonstrated the animation system and artificial intelligence.[38] Valve Software hired science fiction author Marc Laidlaw in August 1997 to work on the game's characters and level design.[35] Half-Life's soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey.[17] Half-Life was originally planned to be shipped in late 1997, to compete with Quake II, but was postponed when Valve decided the game needed significant revision.[39]
As Freeman tries to make his way out of the ruined facility, he soon discovers that he is caught between two sides: the hostile aliens and the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, a U.S. Marine Corps special operations unit dispatched to cover up the incident by eliminating the organisms, as well as Dr. Freeman and the other surviving Black Mesa personnel to keep them from talking.
After a series of controversies and delays, Half-Life 2 was released on November 16, 2004.[55] On June 1, 2006 Half-Life 2: Episode One was released.
Instead, such organisms occasionally define chapters, and the player is generally expected to use the terrain, rather than firepower, to kill the "boss".
When Gordon accepts, he is placed into stasis and congratulated by the G-Man.
Like Opposing Force for the PC and Decay for the PS2, the Dreamcast version was set to have its own exclusive expansion, Blue Shift.
The sequel, Half-Life 2, was merely a rumor until it was finally revealed at E3 in May 2003, which ignited a firestorm of hype surrounding the game.
It has also been speculated that the Lambda symbol was chosen as it somewhat resembles a very simple picture of an arm holding a crowbar, the first weapon acquired by Gordon Freeman, and a weapon for which the Half-Life series is famous.[13]
However, despite only weeks from release, it was cancelled; Sierra announced this "due to changing market conditions" onset by third-party abandonment of the Dreamcast and ceased production of the console itself.[46] The Dreamcast edition, in a near finished state, was eventually leaked onto the internet.[47]
The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine.
This version was released in North America in late October of the same year, followed by a European release just a month later.
The Dreamcast version revamped the graphics of the game with double the polygon count of the original models.
The G-Man praises Freeman's actions in Xen.
Freeman fights the Marines before reaching the surface of Black Mesa, where he learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have the means to resolve the problems created by the cascade.
Meanwhile Gordon goes through underground water channels as aliens pick off the remaining Marines.[26] He arrives at the Lambda Complex, where scientists developed the teleportation technology that allowed travel to Xen in the first place.[27] After meeting the remaining personnel, Gordon is told the satellite he launched failed to reverse the effects of the resonance cascade because an immensely powerful being on the other side of the rift is keeping it open.
Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialised.
Metacritic 96/100 (PC)[69]
87/100 (PS2)[70]
Aggregate scores
Half-Life itself is a reference to the half-life of a quantity (such as a radioactive material), the amount of time required for the quantity to decay to half of its initial mass.
Despite the praise that the game has received, there have also been some complaints.
Gordon travels to the other end of the facility to assist them.[20] However, Gordon encounters several hurdles throughout the facility, such as reactivating a rocket engine test facility to destroy a giant creature of three tentacles,[21] using an aged railway system in order to get to and launch a crucial satellite rocket,[22] and fighting a group of Black Ops soldiers,[23] before he is captured by Marines and dumped in a garbage compactor.

However, it does take advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine.
Gordon must therefore kill this being to stop the Xenian invasion and the scientists activate the teleporter to send Gordon to Xen.[27]
His journey consists of sidestepping Black Mesa's structural damage and defending himself against hostile Xen creatures, such as the parasitic headcrab which attaches itself to a human host before enslaving it.
Set 48 hours into the game, Uplink's levels are heavily revised variations of levels cut during Half-Life's development phase, and are not present in the end version of the full game.
In response to this, a third-party mod remake called Black Mesa was developed.
It's one of the best games of any year, an instant classic that is miles better than any of its immediate competition, and - in its single-player form - is the best shooter since the original Doom".[71] IGN described it as "a tour de force in game design, the definitive single player game in a first person shooter".[73] IGN has also respected the game as one of the most influential video games.[74] GameSpot claimed that it was the "closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken".[75] GameSpot inducted Half-Life into their "Greatest Games of All Time" list in May 2007.[76] In 2004, GameSpy held a Title Fight, in which readers voted on what they thought was the "greatest game of all time", and Half-Life was the overall winner of the survey.[77] In the November 1999, October 2001, and April 2005 issues of PC Gamer, Half-Life was named "Best Game of All Time"/"Best PC Game Ever".[5][6][78] GamesRadar also placed it in its list of 100 best games of all time.
The titles of Half-Life and its expansion packs are all named after scientific terms.
Opposing Force, while it could be named because the player assumes the role of one of the enemies in the original game, is also a reference to Newton's third law of motion, while Blue Shift refers to the blue shifting of the frequency of radiation caused by the Doppler effect or special relativity, in a similar parallel reference to the name of the work shift that the main character takes (as stated in the manual included with the retail version of the game).
Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods.
Main article: List of GoldSrc engine mods From its release in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support from independent game developers, due in no small part to support and encouragement from Valve Software.
Valve, set up by former Microsoft employees, had difficulty finding a publisher for the game, with many believing that it was too ambitious a project.
In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees "through his eyes" for the entire length of the game.
Reaching the surface once more, Gordon finds a warzone.
He fights his way through Gonarch, the huge egg laying headcrab,[29] an alien camp and arrives at a massive alien factory, which is creating the Alien Grunt soldiers.[30] After fighting his way through levitating creatures, he finds a giant portal and enters it.[30] In a vast cave, Gordon confronts the Nihilanth, the entity maintaining the rift, and destroys it.[31] The Nihilanth dies in an explosion, knocking Gordon unconscious.
The game's protagonist is the theoretical physicist Gordon Freeman, who holds a Ph.D. from MIT.
However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a "resonance cascade",[18] opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called Xen.[19] Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of various alien lifeforms, including a circle of Vortigaunts, shortly before blacking out.[19]
The game's plot was originally inspired by the video games Doom, Quake (both PC games produced by id Software), and Resident Evil (published by Capcom), Stephen King's short story/novella The Mist, and an episode of The Outer Limits called "The Borderland".[16] It was later developed by Valve's in-house writer and author, Marc Laidlaw, who wrote the books Dad's Nuke and The 37th Mandala.[17] Story[edit]
Numerous single player mods have also been created, like USS Darkstar (1999, a futuristic action-adventure on board a zoological research spaceship), The Xeno Project 1 and 2 (1999–2005, a two-part mod starting in Xen and again including spaceships), Edge of Darkness (2000, which features some unused Half-Life models), Half-Life: Absolute Redemption (2000, which brings back Gordon Freeman for four additional episodes and another encounter with the G-Man), They Hunger (2000–2001, a survival horror total conversion trilogy involving zombies), Poke646 (2001, a follow-up to the original Half-Life story with improved graphics), Someplace Else (2002, Side story to the original Half-Life), and Heart of Evil (2003, Vietnam war with zombies).[62]
Half-Life was the first product of Valve Software, a software developer based at Kirkland, Washington founded in 1996 by former Microsoft employees Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell.[32] Valve settled on a concept for a horror-themed 3D action game using the Quake engine licensed from id Software.[33] Valve eventually modified the engine a great deal, notably adding skeletal animation and Direct3D support;[32] a developer stated in a PC Accelerator magazine preview that seventy percent of the engine code was rewritten .[citation needed] Valve initially struggled to find a publisher, many believing their project too ambitious for a studio headed by newcomers to the video game industry; however, Sierra On-Line had been very interested in making a 3D action game, especially one based on the Quake engine, and signed Valve for a one-game deal.[34]
Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.[48]
Entering the borderworld Xen, Gordon encounters organisms[28] that had been brought into Black Mesa, as well as the remains of HEV-wearing researchers that came before him.
That year Sierra On-Line showed its PlayStation 2 port at E3 2001.
Freeman awakens in the ruined test chamber and surveys the destroyed lab, strewn with the bodies of scientists and security personnel.
The game also features numerous conventional weapons, such as the Glock 17 pistol (with the HD pack enabled, it resembles a Berreta), Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun (with the HD pack enabled, the stock is folded up), MP5 submachine gun with an attached M203 grenade launcher (with the HD pack enabled, it resembles a M16), Colt Python .357 Magnum revolver, and rocket launcher as well as unusual weapons ranging from a crossbow to weapons from Xen and genetically engineered weapons such as an organic homing gun and flesh-eating parasites called "Snarks".
Another interesting feature allowed players to use a USB mouse and keyboard, a feature previously unused on the platform.[44]
Versions for the Dreamcast and "classic" Mac OS were essentially completed, but never commercially released.[45] Gearbox Software was slated to release a port to the Dreamcast under contract by Valve and their then publisher Sierra On-Line near the end of 2000.
Many of us had fallen in love with videogames because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field, and felt like the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities.
The player also faces human opponents, in particular Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (HECU) Marines and black ops assassins who are dispatched to contain the extra-dimensional threats and silence all witnesses.[15]
Other multiplayer mods include Day of Defeat (DOD), Action Half-Life, Firearms, Science and Industry, The Specialists, Pirates, Vikings and Knights and Natural Selection.
First released in 1998 by Sierra Studios for Windows PCs, the game was also released for the PlayStation 2;[2] Mac OS X and Linux ports became available in January 2013.[3] In Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong.
Two official demos for Half-Life were released.
For the most part the player battles through the game alone, but is occasionally assisted by non-player characters; specifically security guards and scientists who help the player, the former who will fight alongside and both who can assist in reaching new areas and impart relevant plot information.[14] A wide array of enemies populate the game including parasites of Xen such as headcrabs, bullsquids, headcrab zombies and Vortigaunts.
Most of the game is set in a remote desert area of New Mexico in the Black Mesa Research Facility, a fictional complex that bears many similarities to both the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Area 51, at some point during the 2000s.
Half-Life is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game.
A short film based upon Half-Life entitled Half-Life: Uplink, was developed by Cruise Control, a British marketing agency, and was released on March 15, 1999.
Finding survivors, Freeman learns that communication to the outside is completely cut and is encouraged to head to the surface for help because of the protection afforded by his suit.
The Electric Playground said that Half-Life was an "immersive and engaging entertainment experience", but said that this only lasted for the first half of the game, explaining that the game "peaked too soon".[84]
Valve offers Half-Life-related products such as a plush vortigaunt, plush headcrab, posters, clothing, and mousepads.[79][80]
A free team-based multiplayer mod called Underworld Bloodline was created to promote the Sony Pictures movie Underworld.[61]
Black Mesa, a fan-made remake of Half-Life utilising the Source engine, began development in 2005,[63] and was released as a free download on September 14, 2012.[64][65] The free 2007 Source SDK base is needed to run the game.
Designed for Windows, the game's engine, GoldSrc, was a heavily modified version of id Software's Quake game engine with code portions from the id Tech 2 engine.[1][4]
Unlike its peers at the time, Half-Life used scripted sequences, such as a Vortigaunt ramming down a door, to advance major plot points.
The first part of the Black Mesa modification was released on September 14, 2012, with the second promised to be coming later.[58]

The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu[153] and Ryukyuan peoples, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[154] There are persons of mixed ancestry incorporated among the 'ethnic Japanese' or Yamato, such as those from Ogasawara Archipelago where roughly one-tenth of the Japanese population can have European, American, Micronesian and/or Polynesian backgrounds, with some families going back up to seven generations.[155] In spite of the widespread belief that Japan is ethnically homogeneous (in 2009, foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up only 1.7% of the total population),[156] also because of the absence of ethnicity and/or race statistics for Japanese nationals, at least one analysis describes Japan as a multiethnic society, for example, John Lie.[157] However, this statement is refused by many sectors of Japanese society, who still tend to preserve the idea of Japan being a monocultural society and with this ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the Ainu and Ryukyuan people.
