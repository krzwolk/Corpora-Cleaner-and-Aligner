He was opposed to the principle of induction in the formulation of physical theories.
This was the first step to the discovery of corpuscular-wave dualism.
I would like to thank you for your letter of extremely important and interesting information.
What is behind the act of the will, to light his pipe?
What's more, I think that science without religion is lame and, conversely, religion without science is blind.
I feel that I want to smoke a pipe and I light it - where is there a place for freedom?
That's why I'm going to draw your attention to the following facts and recommendations:
For 17 years he was subjected to the king of Württemberg.

Throughout his life, he rejected the idea of ​​a personal God and his views were for the better part of his life close to the pantheism of Spinoza in the spirit, that is, he believed in a kind of general spiritual world order, which is expressed, among others, the ability of people to perceive this order and formulate it as the laws of science.
The year 1905 is known as the Annus mirabilis (wonderful year) Einstein [51].

This second requirement can be expressed, brutally, though honestly, in the following way: Not only we want to know what is the Nature (and how to run its processes), but also, as far as possible to achieve perhaps utopian and pretentious sounding goal - to learn why Nature is what it is, and not another.
The theory of relativity has taught me one more thing: even with the richest set of empirical facts can be derived not so complicated equations.
The theory can be empirically confirmed, but there is no way of experience to the design theory.
Physical theory is characterized by two aspirations:
This new phenomenon will allow the construction of bombs and it is conceivable - though less certain - that may arise in this way extremely powerful bombs of a new type.
This, of course, a lie what you read about my religious; lie that is repeated time and time again.

He also claimed that if a theory can not be represented by the image of the physical, it probably is useless [127].
He claimed that the particle actually has the momentum and position in the classical sense, but their inability to simultaneously determine the resulting uncertainty principle can take when quantum mechanics will replace the newer theory, "repealing" indeterminacy.

He acknowledged that the world in fact is built in a classical and relativistic and quantum mechanics force in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle only temporarily limited our knowledge [161].
In 1881 the family moved to Munich, where he was made a bet, there is also November 18, 1881, she gave birth to Maria [8] [9], the only sister of Einstein. Albert Einstein first came into contact with science, when he was five.
In 1906, Einstein was promoted to technical expert second class [46], however, did not stop to deal with physics.
In 1907 he formulated the principle of equivalence [54], which was later called "the happiest thought of his life" [55], since launched his thoughts on the general theory of relativity.
In 1910, the first time it was reported as a candidate for the Nobel Prize [64]. In 1911
In 1919, during a solar eclipse, two British scientific expeditions have measured deviation of the track light from the stars behind the Sun and passing next to him - published in a report by Arthur Eddington's results confirmed the predictions of Einstein's theory [78] [79].
In 1921
In 1923, he published an article under the title Is the theory of field creates opportunities to solve the problem of quantum [96] These works were doomed to failure, because at this time not known yet strong and weak interactions. In October 1936,
In 1930, Einstein again sailed to America, traveling from December 1930 to March 1931 and from December 1931 to March 1932 at Caltech in Pasadena. [88]
In 1935 he sailed to Bermuda to get back immigrant visas [92].
In 1950, the observed expansion of the aneurysm. [106]
In a radio program broadcast on May 1946 he said: "
In the past four months it has become probable that through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America that fail to lead to a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of energy rise and a large abundance of new elements resembling advice.
During World War I, in addition to the general theory of relativity, Einstein published papers on cosmology and gravitational waves, found a new derivation of Planck's law, written fifty articles and published a book popularizing the theory of relativity [80].
During his stay in Princeton, Einstein was working on a unified field theory [95] which describe gravity and electromagnetism as two manifestations of the same phenomenon.
During her studies she fell in love with the reciprocal in Milevie Maric [32] [33], which did not like the mother of Einstein [34] [35] [36]. In 1901
During this visit, on May 9, he received an honorary doctorate from Princeton University [86]. May 30th sailed to England.
In June 1914, there has been a separation [76] [77], therefore the sons of Mileva returned to Zurich. General Relativity and Nobel Prize [Edit | Edit Code]
In June, he was hired for a probationary period as a technical expert third class at the patent office [35] [48] [46], and three months later he was hired permanently.
On the way back from a trip they went to Spain. March 15, 1923 was returned to Berlin.
As a result, Einstein became an ardent supporter of the theory of hidden variables, capturing the existence of particles in a classical way, and not agreeing with the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function [162].
In December 1908,
In December 1953 he became an honorary rector of the Hebrew University [104] and received the Lord and Taylor Award [26].

In the years 1925-1927 he was a member of its Governing Council.
In July 1900, they both joined the final exams, which Einstein has passed, as opposed to Milevy Maric [29] [30]. He then published his first work on the phenomenon of capillarity [31].
In November 1952
In a letter to Max Born wrote this: You believe in a God who plays dice, and I in the reign of order in the world objectively existing, which I'm trying to grasp the way of wild speculation. [129] Worldview [edit | edit code]
In a letter to Max Born 1944 he wrote:
In February 1902, he moved to Berne [45], as expected to get a permanent job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.
In March 1909 he became professor of theoretical physics at the University of Zurich [60] [61] [62].
In March 1914, he moved with his family to Berlin. [73]
In March 1932, he returned to Germany.
At the time of publication of the special theory of relativity was thus formally Swiss.
On receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize was therefore formally German and Swiss simultaneously and both nationalities present in the official lists of Nobel Prize winners. [122]
In the last years of his life Einstein he had pain in the upper abdomen, and in autumn 1948, the doctor detected in the tumor size of an orange. [106]
In Monday 18 April 1955 at 1.15 Einstein died [107]. On the same day his body was cremated at Trenton, and the ashes be scattered at an undisclosed location [108].
In fact, I think it is a very close relationship between them.
In their scientific interests, I focused on essentials.
During this time, Einstein began to study at home.
At the time, received a job offer from Jerusalem, Oxford, Leiden, Madrid and Paris [90].
During this time he was there movement of matter through the ether and the kinetic theory of gases [42].
In the same year he received honorary doctorates from the University of Geneva. [60] In the years 1909-1911 he wrote eleven scientific papers on theoretical physics [63].
In the same year, probably in order to avoid military service [26] or to protest against the ruling military sentiment in Germany [27], renounced his German citizenship and stateless started again for exams at ETHZ, which this time has passed.
Conditions set out, that Albert has to pay alimony, deposit in the bank 40 000 German marks, of which interest had to be at the disposal of his ex-wife, and moreover, if he got the Nobel Prize, he had to tell her the whole amount [83] [84].
Contrary to established beliefs Einstein rerouted their theory principles of relativism.
In September 1896, he graduated there, give a good assessment of nearly all subjects, especially with singing and music, physics and mathematics [25] [c].
According to Maria Einstein during this period her brother became nervous, there were even signs of depression [21].
In the spring of 1913, Max Planck and Walther Nernst offered him membership adoption of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (Akademie der Preusissche Wissenschaftlen), professor of law at the University of Berlin, but without the obligation lining, and a director of the future Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (Kaiser Wilhelm Institut für Physik, which is now the Institute of Physics in Berlin) [69] [70] [71] [72]. Einstein, weary work of teachers, he wanted to focus solely on thinking [72] and the offer accepted.
The contribution to the philosophy of science [edit | edit code]
He brought also contribute to the development of the philosophy of science.
This resulted in the formulation of his theory of general relativity. He said: "
Together they decided to send to the then U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's letter [97] [d] as follows: "
Admission
All rejected. October 7, 1933, the sailed with his wife, assistant and secretary to America [91] [92].
Then the unknown in the physics Swiss patent clerk published several works breakthrough for physics.

When asked in 1918 about the theory of relativity Einstein said: If the theory of relativity proves to be true, the Germans will call me a great German, Swiss Swiss and the French great scholar.
Therefore, the correct court derives its "truthfulness" of the truth of a logical system to which he belongs [125].

Due to unfavorable weather conditions, the American ship was able to find only one unit of the Japanese - serving as a naval auxiliary ship, passenger-transport ship "Ohio Maru", which sank on August 6 [3].
However alerted escorts who imperceptibly approached the submerged unit.
Operating the elevation angle range was -10 ° to 85 °.
However, he was attacked by enemy escorts, which forced the unit to a deep draft, where he remained for four hours, pelted with a total of 99 depth charges [3].
No Japanese unit did not fall on the ship posed by mines immediately.

C + + library interfaces related systems are not portable beyond the hem, which results from the fact that such interfaces are specific to the system and does not apply solely to C + +.
Features standards [edit | edit code]
It is characterized by high performance object code, direct access to hardware resources and system functions, ease of creation and use of libraries (written in C + +, C or other languages), independent of specific hardware platform or system (which ensures high portability of source code) and a small runtime environment.
Declaration of limiting exceptions: throw (...) (defining what exceptions can be propagated from the function / method)
Declaration capture exceptions: try ... catch
Declaration calling exception: throw
Destructors, that function is called implicitly before (strictly fixed) deleting the object
To date (2012) no popular compiler is not fully compliant with the current standard language, although the possible non-compliance concern only secondary language features (such as the implementation of the keyword export) [9] [10].
Dynamic initialization of global variables and local static variables (ie, can be initialized to the function)
Dynamic control types (RTTI), or dynamic (checked at runtime) cast between types of related classes, and specify the type at run-time (dynamic_cast and typeid operators)
Inheritance (including a cross-inheritance)
Thanks to this well-written program in C + + is generally at least as fast as its counterpart written in C; moreover, through the use of generic algorithms in many cases, C + + is significantly faster than the C (e.g., when sorting) [8].
Features expandable (inline) (also C99)
member functions
History [edit | edit code]
Increment is to increase the number by 1, in C + + to implement it is used for the above. the operator; for example:
int main ()
One of these is the C + + Comeau - one of the few compilers offer full support for the standard language.
C + + is a language wieloparadygmatowym [7].
C + + is not the property of any person, institution or corporation.
Language C + + has its official standard (currently it is C + +11 from 2011).
C + + to directly manage memory space.
C + + is based on the static type checking; also has elements of dynamic type checking.
C + + because of the very extensive syntax and strict requirements in terms of performance code is a big challenge for developers of compilers [8].
C + + was created in the eighties of the twentieth century (the first version appeared in 1979) by Bjarne Stroustrup as an object-oriented language extension C. In addition to the C language, the definition of the C + + language influenced languages ​​such as Simula (which took the properties of object-oriented) and Algol, Ada, ML and Clu.
Class, as an extension of the structure of the member functions, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
Constructors (also used for implicit conversion, and later also added the ability to prohibit implicit conversion by constructor with the explicit)
Mechanisms of encapsulation:
Methods and static fields
Virtual methods provide polymorphism
The possibility of object-oriented programming:
The ability to access the global variable obscured by the operator ::
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the number of programmers in C + + was estimated at about 3,000,000 [1].
Name of C + + is so symbolic statement that it is the language C, modernized, with more opportunities.
Name of C + + refers to the fact of being a "successor in C", by using the increment operator in the "+ +".
Language name was proposed by Rick Mascitti in 1983, when he first used the language outside the science lab.
Some of the changes in the standard C language were inspired by the C + + language (eg word inline in C99).
New features of C + + ANSI C language with respect to the 1989 [edit | edit code]
A new type of logical bool and constant true and false (the C99, except that in C + + are the keywords)
Objects, which are instances of classes
Exception handling:
Since 1998, applies standard ISO / IEC 14882:1998 (Standard for the C + + Programming Language) with minor amendments adopted in 2003 (ISO / IEC 14882:2003).
It reflects the fact that this language is an extension of the C language previously used the name "C with Classes".
Operators new and delete
Operators precise projection: dynamic_cast (only cast between types, taking into account the class hierarchy), reinterpret_cast (forced only cast between types) and const_cast (changing cast modifiers const and volatile)
This means that it can be used at the same time different styles of programming, including procedural programming, object-oriented, generic, as well as program-level assembler.
The first compilers for C + +, like cfront were only translators into C Compilers are available today.
The first native compiler (producing once assembly code) for C + + was the g+ + package GCC, whose first author was Michael Tiemann, founder of Cygnus Solutions.
Initially, the C + + language was available in the standard, which was developed in the latest version of the compiler cfront (translates C + + to C), and later published the first informal standard called ARM (Annotated Reference Manual), which drew Bjarne Stroustrup and Margaret Ellis.
The primary applications include applications and operating systems. C + + was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language with object-oriented mechanisms for data abstraction and strong static type checking.
The following program outputs to the standard output device "Hello World":
Programs written in C + + can also use the C language library resources
Project C + + is trying to maintain the greatest possible compatibility (at the source code level) with the language C. Compatibility between the two languages ​​was not always complete, but so far any differences were negligible in practice [6].
The draft language assumes that no new (relative to the C language) feature of C + + does not have a negative impact on the speed of the program or the demand for working memory.

Treating the definition of variables and objects as ordinary user
Facilities associated with a generic programming:
This allows the abstraction of data and the use of several programming paradigms: procedural, object-oriented and generic.
Note: Some of these items went to the C language standard in 1999 (called C99).
In 2009, it was announced the new standard (known as C + +0 x), which took effect from 12 August 2011 [2], [3], but is still waiting for the publication (ISO / IEC 14882:2011) [4] [5].
Most useful programs in C + + requires the use of custom libraries.
A bigger problem was the incompatibility compatibility compiler C + + in terms of syntax supported - for many years to programs written for one did not work at another.
Properties of language [edit | edit code]
The inclusion in the standard library of generic STL
Indicators for the components (fields and methods)
Twentieth century language C + + has established one of the most popular general-purpose programming languages.
Compliance with C-level source code remains one of the fundamental objectives of the project following language standards. In the 90s

The most important in terms of tourism districts are numbered 1-8.
The main airport is the airport. Charles de Gaulle Airport located in located 40 km north-east of Paris, Roissy-en-France.
The highest recorded temperature was 40.4 ° C on July 28, 1948 and the lowest was -23.9 ° C on 10 December 1879, [3]
These include, for example the great works of literature as the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary in Paris, Victor Hugo, Balzac Father Goriot Honoré, The Three Musketeers and The Queen Margot and other novel by Alexandre Dumas father, Lady of the Camellias by Alexandre Dumas son, Scenes from the life of a bohemian Henry Murger, Hopscotch by Julio Cortazar , Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller or even contemporary bestsellers - The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown and Patrick Süskind Perfume.
Shortly thereafter, on March 18, broke the Paris Commune.
Soon after, the town began to develop on the left bank of the Seine River (today's Latin Quarter).

The history of research on Erebuni [edit | edit code]
Information supplied a clay tablet from the vintages of King Argisztiego I. The town was founded in 782 years BC
The inscription reads: "the power of God Chaldiego I made an expedition against the land of Hatti [11] ... At the command of God Chaldiego Argiszti, Menu, son, saith:" Town Irpuni built for power and land Biajnili to subvert hostile land. The land was a desert, nothing on it was not built.
It was likely that the plaque with the name of the city, which was discovered in 1950 by Oganiesiana, accidentally hit the hill. In 1958, the hypothesis was confirmed.
He directed excavations B. B. Piotrowski. Since the regular items were found with the words "Erebuni" on-site excavations in the nearby Tejszebaini remained doubts whether you really ruins of the city of Erebuni are on Arin Berd.
City Erebuni consisted of a citadel, situated on a hill Arin Berd, and urban neighborhoods, located at the foot of the hill.
Local people Aza land, known as the annals urartyjskich Argisztiego I put initially resisted Urartyjczykom who in the eighth century BC conducted expansionary policies in the north.

On the great peristyle courtyard of the fortress and preserved wells, which flowed rainwater. Were equipped with a drainage system. Probably the water from the citadel were not used in the residential districts of the city, because it was missing.

The area, which included, was divided between the thirteenth and eighteenth satrapy of the Achaemenid state. Presumably at least a century after the fall of Urartu Erebuni secured the northern borders of the empire. After the fourth century BC the city was setting on the decline [5] [18]. Layout of the city [edit | edit code]
Since 1968, Erebuni Museum is located in the north-western part of the slope of the hill Arin Berd.
Since then, Arin Berd in the area of ​​sustainable construction, which caused numerous difficulties during archaeological excavations. [13] Unlike other Transcaucasian cities urartyjskich as Tejszebaini and Argisztihinili, the city-fortress of Erebuni was intended for military purposes and did not integrate with urban buildings [5].
You entered in the declining period of its existence, and losing political and military position.
After the fall in 609 years BC Assyria, Urartu eternal rival, during the reign of Rusy III, son Erimeny, the political center of the state, located previously in the area of ​​Lake Van, moved north to areas of Transcaucasia. This resulted in a short-lived renaissance Erebuni. As is clear from the preserved inscriptions times Rusy III, the city has produced several new granaries.
When submitting victims through the smoke hole was considered. The interior walls were decorated with paintings.
Mighty deeds accomplished there.
It was created as an alternative theory about the ethnic composition of Erebuni.
Half a century later, in 1947, BB Piotrowski, who led the archaeological work on a nearby hill Karmir Blur, conducted a preliminary study on Arin Berd.

The walls were paintings, usually on a blue background. During the Achaemenid half Chaldiego temple was used for economic purposes, the other half allocated to the Apadana. Susi temple was built on the plane of a rectangle measuring 10 × 13.45 m inner room had dimensions of 5.02 × 8.08 m

The temple was built in the shape of a ziggurat.

This part of the ancient Erebuni was destroyed as a result of intensive construction work in the twentieth century [13].
Signs urartyjskie describing the construction of Erebuni
This assertion is not supported by the sources. So far not discovered historical literature, and significant artefacts from the period between the fall of the Achaemenid state in the fourth century BC and the appearance of the first traces of Armenian culture in the third century. [8] However, Armenian scientists are convinced about the relationship between Yerevan Erebuni and [9].
It was found that the frames were made of thick wooden beams.
In 2002, in the south-eastern part of Arin Berd resumed archaeological work, funded by the Open Society Institute [14].
In the center - played wall of the temple Chaldiego with elements of the peristyle.
In the valley Urartyjczycy have good conditions for the development of agriculture and expand the irrigation system.
The Erebuni not found any traces of fires and looting of the city by the invaders. [5]
The top layer was discovered iron bits, originating likely, from the period when the Ararat Valley tribes invaded Iran [24]. The findings indicate that, after the fall of Urartu Erebuni continue operating in the Achaemenid period. Territory where the town was located, the time was called Armenia; under this name occurred in the Greek and Persian written sources.
In the city there was a sewage plant.
The study adopted the name "Erebuni". In 1950, the press was published Kapanciana GR theory, which argued that the name "Yerevan" is etymologically cognate with the name of the city urartyjskiego [7].
In some places the height of the walls reached twelve feet. In order to connect the stones and bricks used mortar made of clay.
In some cases, the wall is strengthened by the arcs of the bricks.
During this period of Urartu was at the peak of its power and was the strongest country in the territory of Asia Minor. Argiszti I was interested in expanding the frontiers of Urartu and protection of the state from the north to the height of Ararat Valley.
The V-IV centuries BC the fortress was occupied by the Persians, and was completely forgotten [5] [18].
Therefore, the on-site Erebuni is now the capital of Armenia, the ancient city is often equated with Yerevan.
Exposed in the findings of Erebuni and neighboring Tejszebaini, the most valuable exhibits replaced by copies.
On the other hand, between the names of Yerevan Erebuni and it is possible etymological relationship [18].

Was located on a hill Arin Berd a height of about 65 m during the construction of the fortress top of the hill has been aligned. The overall area of ​​the citadel was about 8 hectares.
It has been abandoned by Urartyjczyków in the sixth century BC in the face of the threat from the Persians. After nearly dwuwiekowym Persian domination in the valley fortress town was abandoned and forgotten. They were discovered again until the end of the nineteenth century.

1 The period before the founding of the Abbey Theatre
11 May 1904 the authorities agreed to the proposal Horniman, who assumed that they will become users of the scene.

Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland, irl.
Abbey reopened July 18, 1966.
Amharclann on Mainistreach - theater in Dublin, was established in December 27, 1904, with a break caused by the fire of the original building in 1951.
Brother Yeats, Jack Yeats, was commissioned to paint portraits of all the most important figures of the Society for the foyer.
It was a one-man show entitled Kicking a Dead Horse; the role played by Stephen Rea, Irish actor Oscar nominee, who began his career at the Abbey many years before.
What's more, the numerous trips abroad and issuing units outside the country, especially in North America, has become an important tourist attraction because of its high recognition [2].
Daily administration rested on Lennox Robinson.
For example, in 1935-1939 he sat on the board of Frank O'Connor, serving as Managing Director since 1937; during this period there staged two plays.
On 12 May 2005, the then artistic director Ben Barnes, as well as managing director Brian Jackson submitted their resignations after the financial reports of serious irregularities were discovered, which resulted in a serious underestimation of the deficit of the theater, of 1.85 million.
On 7 May 1910, when all the other theaters in town were closed due to the death of King Edward VIII, Robinson decided that the Abbey Theatre will open.
The target group of the audience were representatives of the working class, not the middle class, who were the usual recipients of this type of events.
She came to Dublin in 1903 as an unpaid secretary Yeats, as well as the implementation of the costumes for the play The King's Threshold.
On the second evening, and In the Shadow of the Glen replaced with other pieces of the President of the Society.
Thanks to a grant from the total amount of the grant has increased by 43%; was also the highest in the history of the Council.
The effect of the latter were riots similar to those induced by Playboy Synge'a, which took place nineteen years earlier. Once again, the frightened reaction of viewers management Abbey refused to issue further his work. O'Casey emigrated from Ireland shortly thereafter [6].
Frank Fay playing Cúchulainn in On Baile's Strand, was the first actor scenes at Abbey Road. Although Horniman designed the costumes, neither she nor Lady Gregory was not on the spot.
Horniman returned to England and its role was to be - in addition to providing funds - the organization of the public and a reservation for tour performances in London and the provinces.
His career as a playwright began the art of The Shadow of a Gunman, the exhibition at Abbey Road in 1923.
John Millington Synge
Johnson decided to change the name, and The Old Lady Says 'No' was staged by the Gate on stage Peacock in 1928 [8].
When Denis Johnston submitted his first play, Shadowdance, the leadership of the Abbey, was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with a note on the title page of sounding The Old Lady Says No (Mature lady says "No").
When building Hibernian Theatre of Varieties at Abbey Street, and the building in Marlborough Street became available after the close of the authorities there already functioning institutions for reasons of fire safety, Horniman and William Fay agreed to acquire and adapt to the needs of the Society.
Another indicator of the Abbey Theatre ambition at the time was the fact that none of the interesting contemporary playwrights, nor Brendan Behan, Samuel Beckett or not set there their works.
Despite the fact that the press soon turned against the rebels and protests (known henceforth as the Playboy Riots), this situation shook Abbey and the next (and final completed) art Synge'a, The Tinker's Wedding, it was staged just for fear of against further unrest.
On the basis of its own estimates, has released its functioning 10 350 pounds, which was a considerable sum at the time. [5]
Under the new plan, in January 2006, Irish Arts Council [11] acknowledged Abbey grant, in the amount of 25.7 million euros for a period of three years.
At the news of the Horniman, which lasted longer conflict, has finally decided to break its ties with the Abbey.
The new building, a new generation of writers, with figures such as Hugh Leonard and Brian Friel, as well as an increase in the number of tourists, for whom the greatest cultural attraction was the National Theatre, helped in the reconstruction and stabilization of the financial situation of the theater.
The new director, Fiach Mac Conghail, who was to take over the reins in November 2005, it did in May this year. Abbey Theatre since 2006 [edit | edit code]
The new legal system began operating on Feb. 1, 2006 announcement of the composition of the new board. The year 2007 is a very intense Abbey.
The new theater was the right project, in the performances came many viewers.
This proved to be a great success, in part thanks to Maud Gonne, who played a major role in one of the units.
The first of these was the Irish Literary Theatre.
Poster art inauguration Abbey Theatre. Productions took place between 27 December 1904 and 3 January 1905
This plan, after a short debate, was approved.
When it came time for Juno and the Paycock (1924) and The Plough and the Stars (1926).
After returning William siblings began to stage art in the urban theater halls. As a result, formed WG Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company, the company focused its attention on the development of native talent as an actor.
For the first time the curtain went up on Dec. 24, 1904 year.
After the loss of Horniman, Synge'a and brothers Fay, under the leadership of Robinson, the theater suffered from low interest viewers and - consequently - lower revenues from tickets.
Initially, the art exhibited in Molesworth Hall.
The establishment of the Abbey Theatre was the result of a combination of three different factors.
Later, however, the situation has worsened, as the beginning of the premiere of The Playboy of the Western World, by Synge'a, in 1907. At the insistence of Irish nationalists who believed that theater for little socially engaged, and under the pretext of noticing the lack of respect for Irish women, part of the audience raised a revolt.
The project made Michael Scott; September 3, 1963 the President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera, laid the foundation stone for the new building.
The result was a continuous decrease in the number of viewers.
This decline would have been even greater, but for this theater actors attracted celebrities such as FJ McCormick, and dramatists, including George Shiels, who still managed to move the crowd.

The Company continued its work with the works of such artists as Seumas O'Cuisin, Fred Ryan and finally said Yeats.
The situation is even worse to inform about the incident by the police theater.
Luckily he had also at his disposal one of the best contemporary playwrights, Synge'a.
Art such as Philadelphia Here I Come (1964), The Faith Healer (1979) and Dancing at Lughnasa (1990) Friel, Whistle in the Dark (1961) and The Gigli Concert (1983) Tom Murphy and Da (1973) and A Life (1980) Leonard helped raise the international profile of the theater through successful inscenizacjom on the boards of the West End and Broadway.
The latter, closed in 1933, was led by Ninette de Valois, who created the choreography for many pieces of Yeats.
It was there that his work led the Happy Gang, a group of comedians showcasing sketches, farces and pantomimes to mass audiences. In a sense, the new tenants of their comedies referring to the life of the peasants in terms of repertoire were not significantly distanced from the old.
This trend for a while stopped Sean O'Casey.
The Abbey was the first subsidized with public funds theater in the English-speaking world; 1925 was subsidized by the Irish Free State.
The Abbey between 1966 and 2005 [Edit | Edit Code]
The Abbey after the departure of Yeats [edit | edit code]
The Gate could see the works of young Irish artists.
It was her money could arise Abbey Theatre.
This was accompanied by the subsequent involvement of the company in the City Festival, whose first edition took place in 1957 [9].
Tradition Abbey as theater writers survived after the withdrawal of Yeats with daily administration.
The third and final factor was the presence in the city of Frederick Horniman Annie Elizabeth. Horniman, middle-class, she already had experience of the theater; was involved in the issue of Arms and the Man by George Bernard Shaw in London in 1894.
In 1905, Yeats, Lady Gregory and Synge decided to turn the theater into a capital company - National Theatre Society Ltd., without consultation with the Horniman. Annoyed by this method of treatment, has hired Ben Payne, a former employee of the Abbey that has helped her in opening a new group of the same type in Manchester [4]. The beginnings of the [edit | edit code]
In 1909, shareholders began efforts to become independent from Annie Horniman.
In 1924, Yeats and Lady Gregory offered the government that they communicate to the Abbey as a gift for the Irish people. Despite some critical remarks from the Ministry of Finance, the offer was accepted.
In 1928, Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammoir founded the Gate Theatre, who used the stage to exhibit important works of European and American authors.
The Abbey Theatre began his career too many Irish actors and writers [1].
In December 2004, the theater celebrated its centenary with a series of events, such as performances of amateur theaters around the country, or the opening of a Dublin By Lamplight in November 2004.
The following year founded the Abbey School of Acting (acting school) and the Abbey School of Ballet (ballet school).
In April of 1902 years of art done three performances of George William Russell's Deirdre Ní Houlihan and Cathleen Yeats at St. Theresa's Hall at Clarendon Street.
In February 1961 years remains of the burned building were finally removed and began planning reconstruction.
In March, rebuilt bigger audience. These operations were part of a larger plan that anticipates the modernization of the entire building.
The law Horniman was not resident in Ireland, so all the formalities make any Lady Gregory, and their costs rested on Brytyjce.
In light of this success, which was the undertaking of St. Theresa's Hall, in 1903, there has been to establish the Irish National Theatre Society (Society of the Irish National Theatre [3]).
At the same time, formed with a different theater, called experimental Peacock (PAW).
In the same month, there was the world premiere of Sam Shepard's new play, winner of the Pulitzer Prize.
In the same year ended in collaboration with theater Fay brothers who emigrated to the United States.
Many of them also occurred on the stage, which has brought the reputation of the place of theater writers.
William Fay was appointed manager of the theater and took on the responsibility for training the actors in the new group.
William worked for a time in the 90s of the XIX century itinerant troupe, while Frank was very involved in amateur projects in Dublin.
This was due to, inter alia, that declared that art will be exhibited there in the Irish language. Consequently, in 1925, Abbey became the first theater in the English-speaking world maintained by the state. [7]
Art exhibited there also authors whose works were published (or have in the future show) in print, such as Yeats, Lady Gregory, Moore, Martyn, Padraic Colum, George Bernard Shaw, Oliver St John Gogarty, Wilfrid Blunt, FR Higgins, Thomas MacDonagh, Lord Dunsany, TC Murray and Lennox Robinson.
Then offered three one-act plays: On Baile's Strand, Cathleen Ní Houlihan (by Yeats) and Spreading the News (by Lady Gregory).
The assumption [edit | edit code]
Founded by Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and WB Yeats in 1899 - in collaboration with George Moore - theater staged numerous pieces throughout the city. His work has met with the approval of critics, however, did not survive until the approval of the audience. The second factor was the work of two brothers, William and Frank Fay.
However, he was forced to resign his office after the death of Yeats in 1939.

Which leads to the formula for the frequency of the received wave [1]:
Medical diagnostics [edit | edit code]
For waves propagating in the medium, such as sound waves, the effect depends on the speed of the observer and the source relative to the medium in which these waves to propagate.
For cardiac it is very important not only to determine the anatomical structure of the heart, but also the speed and direction of blood flowing in the biological pump.
For speeds much smaller than the speed of light for both mechanical waves and the light is it: V_Z = \ frac vf {\ Delta f} = a {\ Delta f}
With such measurements can be pre-warn people threatened by violent weather phenomena, such as storms, fronts and tornadoes.
Sound traveling on an adjacent street of the city (not directly at the observer) first carriage is high when this is far, decreases gradually as driving an ambulance.
The Doppler effect for mechanical waves [edit | edit code]
The Doppler effect for light [edit | edit code] light (electromagnetic wave) travels through a vacuum travels at the same speed relative to each observer, not as a mechanical wave speed specified relative to the medium in which it propagates.
The Doppler effect is one of the factors causing broadening of spectral lines.
The Doppler effect is also used in a method of laser-Doppler measurement of skin blood flow, which allows for non-invasive measurement of tissue perfusion of the dermis in the diagnosis of diseases such as diabetes or Raynaud's syndrome.
The Doppler effect is used in ultrasonic flowmeters.
The Doppler effect occurring for the light of stars and other astronomical objects has significant application in astronomical spectroscopy.
The Doppler effect is recorded at the speed of movement in relation to the speed of the wave in the medium, assuming designation:
This effect causes the measurement result police radar made at an angle to the direction of travel of the car is less than the actual speed of the vehicle.
This effect arises from changes in the radial velocity component of the ambulance.
Effect of change in frequency of light is called the relativistic Doppler effect.

Frank McClure, president of the research center APL, suggested then that if the satellite position is known and predictable, the Doppler shift could be used to locate a receiver on the ground [7].
When 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union placed in orbit the first artificial earth satellite Sputnik 1, American physicists William Guier and George Weiffenbach noticed that they are able to determine the location of the satellite in orbit on the basis of the Doppler shift signals received from the satellite.
When the radio waves reflected from a moving object, the frequency perceived by the observer stationary velocity is dependent on the movement.
When in the early twentieth century, astronomers began to study the spectra of other galaxies, we found that most of them have spectral lines redshifted.
When the source emits a wave all the time with the same frequency and not moving, the distance between successive wave crests is uniform in all directions, but when the source is moving, the distance between successive crests is dependent on the direction of wave propagation.
When the source sends another vibration waveform with the same frequency and moves, the distance between successive ridges is dependent on the wave propagation direction.
When a music source is receding, his tone becomes lower.
When the source moves perpendicular to the line connecting the receiver with the source (α = 90 °) does not change its distance from the receiver, even though the receiver receives the wave at a frequency other than that transmitted:
Where α is the angle between the direction of motion of the source and the straight line connecting the source to the receiver.
where:
where: a - for the device constant factor depending on the analyzed frequency wave and its velocity,
The top speed signs in the formulas represent the case when they are facing each other, and the lower a situation in which they have opposite phrases.
History [edit | edit code]
If the observer is approaching the source, the relative velocity of the observer and the wave is equal to VWZ = v + vo, to the time between successive observations of fronts is equal to:
If the ultrasound head can record not only the delay of the echo of the sound emitted, but also its frequency, then the image can be diagnostic contractual colors depict the movement of the body or body fluid.
If the star is moving away (running away) from the observer, all the spectral lines are shifted towards the red (higher wavelength).
If the wave source and receiver are moving relative to each other, there is a time dilation resulting from the special theory of relativity. As a result, if the source and receiver are moving along a straight line and move away from each other, the receiver records the wave frequency [6] [1]: f_o = \ gamma (1 - \ beta) f_z = \ sqrt {\ frac {1 - \ beta} {1 + \ beta}} \, f_z where:
If the source or the observer move in a different direction than the simple combining them, the effect of velocity components induce the source and the observer parallel to the line connecting the source with the observer.
Johannes Stark studying radiation tubular discovers that the light emitted by the Doppler effect subject for these studies obtained in 1919 the Nobel Prize in physics [4].
Meteorological Doppler radars are used to detect the movement of clouds and air, providing data for the observation and weather forecasting.
In addition, the farther the galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth, and its light is more shifted towards higher wavelength (redder in visible light).
On the Doppler principle of operation is based on Doppler radar.
On the basis of these movements can be inferred about their relative masses.
On the idea of ​​constructed the first satellite navigation system, Transit, used by ships of the U.S. Navy.
Scientific study of the effect for the first time conducted Christoph Hendrik Diederik Buys Ballot in 1845
The stationary observer perceives this as a change in frequency of the wave, but the distance between them depend on the location of the observer relative to the direction of movement of the source.
Regardless of the similar effect was observed in 1848 by Armand Fizeau for electromagnetic waves [3].
Image of Doppler radar showing Hurricane Katrina, red color shows the movement of moving away from the radar, and the green approximates the
Observation of the beating heart allows the detection of fetal malformations in the womb. Doctors with the knowledge of the risk can prepare for difficulties after childbirth.
The general formula takes into account the direction of movement of the source and the observer:
Determination of the position [edit | edit code]
Determining the speed of movement [edit | edit code] The Doppler effect is used to determine the speed of the zoom source wave [5].
ultimately
This means that these objects are moving away from us, as in Figure 4
Similarly, if the observer approaches the source, although this distance between the ridges and their speed of propagation is the same in every direction, but the observer often encounters wave crests, giving the impression that a larger frequency waves.
Measurement of blood velocity in the common carotid artery
These measurements led to the formulation of Hubble's law and the theory of the expanding universe.
Measurements of displacement of spectral lines of some stars have shown that the planet's orbit them.
Since the molecules or atoms or ions forming the emitting gas absorbing run at different speeds in different directions, the waves reach the observer are slightly shifted relative to the frequency of waves emitted by a fixed source.
He asked a group of musicians (trumpet), that got into the train and played a ton. He listened to it and observed that the instruments sound becomes higher when the train is coming to him.
The transverse Doppler effect [edit | edit code]
Moving source between sending two successive wave crests, at a time equal to one period of the T wave, travels:
Broadening of spectral lines [edit | edit code]
Speeds source and the observer are relative to the center.
Speed ​​of the wave source can be determined based on the formula for a moving source.
Red shift of spectral lines in the visible range of the supercluster of distant galaxies (right) compared to the Sun (left).
At the same time, these angles are between segment connecting the source to the transmitter, and the velocity vector source or transmitter.
At the opposite sense of movement speed this is negative [1].
The approximation is valid when the speed of the source is much smaller than the wave velocity in the medium.
An example might be echocardiography.
Propagation for Doppler Christian Andreas Doppler, the first in 1842 in his paper [2] described the observed effect of changing the color of the light under the influence of movement in the system of double stars.
The distribution of the particle velocity of gas (at thermodynamic equilibrium is Maxwell distribution) depends on the temperature, the higher the temperature of the light emitting medium, the greater the spectral line broadening [11].
The movement of body fluids such as blood can be observed by measuring the change in frequency and phase of the sound waves reflected from the flowing liquid.

T - period waves generated by the source,
T = \ frac {\ lambda_z} {v + v_ {o}} \;
Thus, in the direction of wave crests another source are transmitted at a shorter distance than if the source rested.
Generalization [edit | edit code]
These devices generate a wave with a well-defined frequency and receive reflected waves.
v - velocity of the wave,
In laser Doppler wibrometrze used to change the wavelength of light reflected from a vibrating object, and through analysis of the wave determined the vibration test system [9] Doppler Radar [edit | edit code]
In imaging studies, diagnostic information is valuable not only the shape of anatomical structures, but also the direction and speed of the tissues.
In the case of waves propagating in the absence of a material medium, such as light in vacuum (generally electromagnetic waves), the significance of the difference in speed is only the source and the observer. [1]
In the case of measuring the wave movement of a substance is used non-reflecting "seeding" consisting of adding to the reflecting particles of the substance.
In the case of resting distance between successive source wave crests are independent of direction, but their frequency is changed by moving meet observer.
In such situations, this difference is taken into account, respectively.
In this way, astronomers have discovered hundreds of giant planets outside the solar system [10].
The receiving system shall be mixing vibrations sent and the reflected wave, emitting low-frequency vibrations, whose frequency is equal to the difference frequency wave sent and received.
Then treating the body as a receiving and sending wave speed given by the formula: V_Z = \ frac {v 2 f} {\ Delta f} = a {\ Delta f}
Introduction [edit | edit code]
It shows that the frequency shift is proportional to the velocity of the observer relative to the source (voz) [5].
The presence of β2 expression has been demonstrated experimentally in 1938 by HE Ives and GR Stilwell using a beam of hydrogen atoms [6].
Determination of the position require complex calculations that perform computer [8] [7].
The combination of the above formulas it follows the pattern that describes the phenomenon when both the source and the observer are moving:
For this reason, an observer can still receive a wave with a different frequency than the broadcast, wherein the change of the source depends on the speed and the angle between the observation direction and the direction of movement of the source [1].
Uses [edit | edit code]
According to figure 3 is not the velocity vector contributes to the Doppler effect.
This phenomenon is called the transverse Doppler effect [6].
Changing the pitch was exactly as previously calculated Doppler.
The change in frequency or wavelength performs by comparing the position of the characteristic spectral lines of a star obtained in the Earth.
Frequency changes caused by the Doppler effect are described by slightly different depending in the case of mechanical waves (e.g., sound waves), than in the case of electromagnetic waves (e.g. light, radio frequency) [1].
It varies depending on the angle between the direction of travel of the carriage, and the direction connecting the ambulance with the observer [5].
What matters is only the radial component (zoom in / out the carriage).
Source closer to disorders that sent in the direction of the movement source, and the wave moves away from moving in the opposite direction.
Δf - the difference frequency waves. This phenomenon is mainly used for determining the velocity of the reflective wave of body motion.

The ammonia enters the circulation and is rapidly excreted by the kidneys.
Lipopolysaccharide antigen may be fucosylated, and resemble the Lewis blood group antigens located on the gastric epithelium [23]. The outer membrane also contains cholesterol glucosides, which occurs in a small number of other bacteria [23].
Examined are two related mechanisms by which H. pylori could promote cancer development.
Studies have shown that large colonies are able to grow in a wide range of oxygen concentrations [18].
Research on the genome of H. pylori are focused on clarifying the pathogenesis and the ability of bacteria to cause disease. Approximately 29% of the loci is in the category of "pathogenesis" base genome.
Non-invasive tests [edit | edit code]
Study IgA, normally found in the gastrointestinal mucosa, a biopsy, however, does not have a high value in the diagnosis of infection [87].
The PCR [edit | edit code] This technique involves an attempt to amplify specific bacterial DNA fragment encoding the toxin - cagA and vacA [99].
This test relies on the detection of serum IgG antibodies to Helicobater pylori.
The bacterium has five main families of outer membrane proteins (OMP) [23]. The largest family includes known and putative adhesin.
This bacteria inhabits the surface epithelial cells of the mucous membrane of the stomach antrum. The World Health Organization estimates that infected with this bacterium is approximately
The bacteria Helicobacter pylori were discovered by German scientists in 1875, but they failed to grow them artificially in the laboratory and quickly forgotten about them [5].
Giemsa staining and by Genta, with a similar sensitivity, provides a much better specificity [111]. In one study noticed a slight edge methods Genta [112].
Biology [Edit | Edit code] The morphology of H. pylori
Blocking these pumps by certain medicines (eg, omeprazole) raises the pH of the stomach, which is the habitat of the organism [28].
None of the labeled CO2 in the breath is negative. The result is obtained after 15-30 minutes.
Feature Feature Result Result
The goal of treatment is to completely remove bacteria embedded in the gastric mucosa, which is referred to as eradication. The vast majority of people with asymptomatic Helicobacter pylori infection is not routinely used.
Characteristic covered with cilia sheath fibers are composed of two flagellin współpolimeryzowanych: flaA and Flab [27]. By pumping pump H + ions out of cells.

Some authors consider this method to be more sensitive than histopathology [78].
Part of the carbon dioxide exhaled by the person will be tested and contain a labeled carbon (positive reaction).
H. pylori virulence factors
Virulence factors [edit | edit code]
For successful breeding requires microaerophilic environment containing 10% CO2 and 95% humidity. Inoculation is the only method in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori 100% specificity.
The microorganisms may be present both, in case of inflammation of the stomach and without the occurrence of any of its attributes.
Dear infection [edit | edit code] Infection with the bacterium occurs in the way of food, usually in early childhood before reaching 10 years of age [1] and has since maintained throughout life, although it was confirmed that in some children may occur spontaneously resolved infection [35] [36].
The second consensus - Canadian 1999 introduced further clarithromycin (amoxicillin and metronidazole next used interchangeably) [117], which showed the highest efficiency of macrolides [40]. According to a second consensus of Maastricht (2000) should be applied [118]: first-line drugs (triple therapy): bismuth salts / inhibitor and clarithromycin, and metronidazole / amoxicillin. Second-line drugs (quadruple therapy) bismuth salts [119] [120], an inhibitor of, metronidazole, tetracycline. If bismuth is not available, use only the last three drugs.
Another proposed mechanism is the "path perigenetyczna" [72], which is the reinforcement of the host cell transformed phenotype by changes in proteins such as cell adhesion proteins.
With the bacterium is very busy [26].
Epidemiology [edit | edit code]
Alkaline phosphatase prepared prepared arginine aminopeptidase
The genome of the organism is also present in saliva, its analysis, however, has little diagnostic value - the result of one study that 11 positive results for 19 people for sure patients [80], sensitivity to others was 25% [99]. The advantages of PCR (feces or saliva) is very high specificity (does not generate false positives) and a short time of waiting for the outcome [99].
The main morphological types of stomach cancer is a type of intestinal and diffuse type [48].
H2N-CO-NH2 + H2O → CO2 + 2 NH3
Helicobacter pylori detected by immunochemical staining usual way of histological hematoxylin and eosin staining did not provide a proper diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori. The interpretation of such preparation requires extensive experience pathologist [110].
Helicobacter pylori produces hydrogenase, which allows it to extract energy from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen (H2) produced by other intestinal bacteria [19].

Another method, with high specificity and sensitivity, a CLOtest [110].
Other methods [edit | edit code] Photography of H. pylori in the electron microscope
There are two main methods for testing for the presence of bacterial urease, the first is much more common:
There are two ways of marking carbon - 14C, or 13C - which are currently used mainly 13C. The first method is cheaper (does not require such specialized analyzer), it was suggested, however, that it can be done at the expense of smaller patient safety [24].
There is also another variant of the assay with the labeled carbon in the urea - labeled CO2 stripe portion passes into the bloodstream, and carbon-labeled sought in this method in the blood, and not in the exhaled air [97].
As first suggested also that they can cause diseases of the stomach, but his observations published only in Polish, "Handbook of diseases of the stomach" [7] and they have passed unnoticed.
One of them is based on the production of free radicals in the vicinity of H. pylori and increasing the rate of mutation of the host cell overlap.
However, the sensitivity is only 50%, which means that half the increase is not achieved, despite the presence of bacteria in a material [109].
However, the majority of infected people do not develop the disease; put forward a number of hypotheses to explain this fact, but none of them received universal approval.
The only states in which it should be applied eradication of iron deficiency anemia, and unexplained chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia [56] [57].
It is non-specific (specificity of about 50%) and generates a pool of false negative results [86], so sometimes an additional diagnosis is carried out of IgA antibodies in the blood and the study of both classes of immunoglobulin improves the diagnostic value [87].
If the response is positive, will be present in the urine labeled nitrogen. The result is obtained after several hours. The sensitivity of the respiratory exceeds 90% and the specificity is even higher [90] [91].
If the reaction occurred, the urea decomposes in the stomach into carbon dioxide and ammonia labeled.
If the above-mentioned reaction was, urea decomposes in the stomach for a radioactive isotope-labeled carbon dioxide and ammonia.
Carcinogenicity [edit | edit code]
Helicobacter pylori colony on the surface of the regenerating epithelium (Warthin-silver stain Starry'ego)
Colonization surrounding groove is preferred for H. pylori due to some distance from the shaft gastric parietal cells, which produce hydrochloric acid [23]. In the remaining approximately
Contact with a small amount of saliva, which occurs for example kiss does not cause infection. There is also the possibility of transmission of infection through oral-anal contact [39].
Treatment [edit | edit code]
Legend (designation digits): [show] Invasive tests rely on the execution of gastroscopy with biopsies.
The material is inserted into the urea solution, and the bacteria break it to ammonia, thereby raising the pH and color change.
Morphology and Physiology [Edit | Edit code] The bacteria H. pylori are similar in morphology to the bacteria Campylobacter, but they are usually larger.
It can be successfully used in evaluating the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy [92] [93] [94].
Can produce biofilms [20], as well as move from the spiral form to form cocci [21], which probably facilitates its survival and spread. Form cocci was not bred, but it was discovered in the water supply network in the United States.
Irradiation received in the course of the study is comparable to natural radiation received by U.S. residents in one month [24].
There was no correlation between resistance and a higher incidence of any organism characteristics (age, gender, etc. activity of the gastric juice.) [131]. In another study originally clarithromycin-resistant strains were 3% and 30% metronidazole [122].
Both sequenced strains have Cag pathogenicity island with a size of approximately 40 kbp (gene sequences, which are assigned the responsibility for the pathogenesis), which contains more than 40 genes. Pathogenicity island is usually absent in H. pylori isolated from the people who are its bearers, but remain asymptomatic [149].
It is now known that H. pylori is responsible for approximately 80% of cases of gastric ulcer and 90% of patients with duodenal ulcer.
It is estimated that in Poland is infected with about 84% of adults and about
From the outset, it is noted that the standard antibiotic therapy did not provide a therapeutic success [116], although the sensitivity of in vitro H. pylori to many antibiotics [40].
Oxidase produces no H2S production
Resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics [edit | edit code] Antibiotic resistance is considered a major cause of therapeutic failure of eradication [131], in addition to the acidic pH of the stomach inactivating antibiotics.
Resistance to clarithromycin [edit | edit code]
Maastricht Consensus (1997) recognized as effective treatment, wherein the combination of the three drugs were used for seven days: a proton pump inhibitor, metronidazole / tinidazole and amoxicillin.
After 14 days at the standard triple therapy, in patients in whom the bacterium was initially sensitive to the drug, resistance to clarithromycin was 27.2% (secondary resistance) [131].
For the first time triple therapy applied in 1987, the Sydney gastroenterologist Thomas Borody.
After removing made selective plating.
After examining the genome in 1989, the strains were classified ultimately Helicobacter [10].
The downloaded material may be subjected to a test for the production of urease, histological evaluation or assumption of culture [74]. The bacteria are not uniformly distributed in all parts of the stomach - is almost always busy area pyloric (antral part), there are also collected clippings for research. Currently part of the cardia and fundus is rare.
The initial name was Campylobacter pyloridis (1984), converted in 1987 to Campylobacter pylori infection [10].
During the analysis of the material should be initially assessed the formulation under low magnification, searching for characteristics of metaplasia or abnormal appearance of the scrap.
Selective plating can be broken by the addition of antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori [105] or by the specific composition (e.g. CHBHP) [106]. Growth was also observed at all common liquid media (except alfaketoglutaranie based medium with yeast extract and enriched with serum), while ensuring suitable culture conditions [107]. The substrate transport can be widely used chocolate agar, on which most of the bacteria is present after three days, and some even after nine [108].
Like other typical gram-negative bacteria, H. pylori outer membrane composed of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
In addition, this type of cancer is more common in people infected organism than in the control group [66]. Infection is more common in people with hepatitis C, and possibly accelerates the development of cirrhosis in its course [67] [68]. Some studies have not confirmed the impact of the bacteria from liver disease [69].
Furthermore, the compound showed contamination with a number of diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, but itself H. pylori infection can not pathognomonic symptoms [40].
Since the biological half-life of the organic carbon is short, there is a potential risk of irradiation of the body [24].
Because not all present in the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori is, be careful with the final diagnosis - the most correct formulation is to identify bacteria like H. pylori.
Antibody levels remained at high levels even after the successful completion of treatment (around 6 months), so it can not be used to evaluate the effectiveness of eradication therapy [89]. Tests for the production of urease [edit | edit code]
The remaining four families include porins, iron transporters, cilia-related proteins and proteins of unknown function.
The medium, on which growth is achieved, inter alia SATFM agar (Serum-and Animal Tissue-Free Medium) [101], the culture medium used for Brucella containing blood [102] cyclodextrin substrate [103], charcoal agar, Columbia or agar medium enriched extract of cyanobacteria [104].
Histopathological specimen [edit | edit code]
Biochemical profile [24]
before its execution.
Before beginning the test, it is advisable to carefully wash your teeth, tongue and throat, as normal flora that lives there producing urease can generate false-positive results (positive test in the absence of Helicobacter pylori) [95].
Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection is a well-documented effect on the development of intestinal type without affecting other morphological type of cancer [48]. Disparities in cancer incidence in different geographical areas can be translated to other bacterial genome in different areas, not all strains are equally virulent (depending on the presence of genes vacA and cagA) [49]. Recognizes the correlation between the presence of bacteria and the presence of early gastric cancer [50]. MALT lymphoma [edit | edit code]
Chronic inflammation associated with H. pylori infection causes atrophy of the mucosa and outbreaks of intestinal metaplasia.
Gastric Cancer [Edit | Edit Code]
Nitrate reduction hippurate hydrolase no no
Considered are: gastro-oral, oral-oral and faecal-oral. Often, the infection can occur through contact with the saliva of an infected person (drinking from a common bottle, food from a common plate) or by eating contaminated hands.
the development of a local inflammatory reaction mucosa
The difference concerned only the numerous cilia that Campylobacter family are extremely rare [9].
The risk of developing cancer is greater if the genome of the bacterium's gene vacA [53]. After the eradication of bacteria is often lymphoma regression, when generated on the background of chronic infection organism [54]. Effects on other diseases [edit | edit code]
Cilia - six spaced polar flagella to move through and penetrate the mucous layer.
Effectiveness is increased if the duration of treatment lasts 10 days (instead of the popular week) [126]. The chances of successful eradication decline after two failed attempts, it proves the presence of drug-resistant strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents [127]. Currently, it is considered to introduce a standard quadruple therapy or sequential therapy, due to the decreased sensitivity of Helicobacter pylori to currently used therapeutics [128].

String test [edit | edit code]
Decreasing the chances of successful breeding, if the inoculum (initial amount of bacteria) was low.
Strains in Poland are the most resistant to metronidazole or clarithromycin.
This group of antibiotics is active only when reduced in the interior of the cell, thus reducing inhibition of the enzyme reduces the therapeutic effect.
This technique is very sensitive - in one study, the correlation between the results of PCR and results obtained using the traditional method was 100% [80].
This technique involves administering to the patient to drink a solution of a radioactive isotope-labeled urea, which is degraded by the current in the gastric mucosa by H. pylori equation:
The test is read after about fifteen minutes.
Urine test - in the molecule is labeled urea nitrogen.
breath test (UBT called - Urea Breath Test) - urea in the molecule is labeled carbon atom.
Breath test takes less than gastroscopy with biopsies, with similar efficacy [98].
Tests for the presence of antibodies [edit | edit code]
Cytotoxic toxin disrupts the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells, and increases the adherence of bacteria to such a damaged epithelium.
Vacuolating toxin (vacA) epithelial cells results in a fusion of the endosomes with lysosomes and promotes the formation of a huge vacuole [31].
Work is underway to develop a vaccine against H. pylori infection. Its use would have the ability to both prevention of disease such as peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The study of the genome of different strains [edit | edit code]
Also facilitates the free movement of urea into the lumen of the stomach [32].
Urease Catalase produces produces
It is believed that the transmission of infection occurs from person to person and it was found that most often infects the child's mother. There are many doubts about the way through which often results in infection [37] [38].
It is believed that the helical shape of the bacteria (which gave the name to type) has facilitated the movement in the mucus layer [2] [3] [4].
It is believed that the reliability of both variants of urease test is similar to the preparation of [96].
In 1893, Italian researcher Giulio Bizzozero described the helical shape of the bacteria that live in the acidic environment of the stomach dog [6]. The second time, regardless of the study in 1875, these bacteria have been noticed by Valery Jaworski running the Jagiellonian University in 1899.
Kornberg in 1952 described the hydrolysis of carbon-labeled 14 C-urea in the stomach cat [8].
In approximately 15% of human cases of producing large quantities of hydrochloric acid changes occur in the area of ​​inflammatory antrum stomach (antrum gastritis), which increase in gastrin [42] and hydrochloric acid (whose secretion is further enhanced by gastrin [43]), and thus the threat of ulcers of the stomach or duodenum.
When H2O2 was added to the culture if it contains H. pylori, should be intense foaming caused by decomposition of the antioxidant system of bacteria - see virulence factors; However, this test is very nonspecific.
If the capsule does not make sense to perform a test for the production of urease as the enzyme can be also prepared by normal flora of the oral cavity and pharynx (false positives). [81] The test may be carried many miles from the facility at which the test if transport to the laboratory will be performed properly. [85]
In the case of acute numerous neutrophils are present, if they become chronic atrophy is also visible, neoplasia and dysplasia of cells of the stomach.
If you are taking proton pump inhibitors shift of colonization towards the top, then it is usually too busy with the bottom of the core [75]. The least expensive method with very high specificity and sensitivity of the material is to subject the biopsy urease test for the production of [76] [77].
In doubtful cases, you can do the test twice, before and after washing the mouth, and then compare the difference of the results [95].
The mucous layer of the stomach protects cells from the effects of hydrochloric acid; In this way the use of the protective bacterium host system.
According to a third of the Maastricht consensus bismuth salts can be used as the first attempt to eradicate [121].
According to the proposed mechanism of signaling perigenetycznego inflammatory factors such as TNF-α can alter gastric epithelial cell adhesion and lead to dispersion and migration of epithelial cells mutant without the need of additional mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as those encoding adhesion proteins [73]. Diagnosis [edit | edit code] A molecular model of H. pylori urease. A prerequisite for the initiation of treatment is to identify the infection. Diagnostics, depending on the need to carry endoscopy, is divided into invasive and non-invasive [74]. It is important that the accuracy of the test can affect: the use of drugs with proton pump inhibitors, medicines in the group H2 blockers taking antibiotics
It seems that the protective function especially strains having cagA gene [62] [63]. In the presence of bacteria in the liver, are at increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma [64] [65].
It has been shown sequential therapy was more effective (Italy) [129] Sequential therapy involves the use of a proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin, 1.0 for five days and then for an additional 5 days proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin and tinidazole (both at a dose of 2 x 500 mg ) [130].
It was shown that gum mastic kill H. pylori in vitro [138] [139] However, in vivo studies have shown no such action [140] [141] [142].
Production of large quantities of urease - an enzyme catalyzing the decomposition of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Ammonia causes neutralization of the hydrochloric acid present in the gastric juice, and increasing the pH in the immediate environment of the bacteria.
The study shows that the bacterium has an impact on the development of approximately 90% lymphoma of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue - cancer of the lymph tissue of the gastrointestinal tract) of the stomach [52], which is the most common location of these tumors throughout the gastrointestinal tract [48].
H. pylori infection is the most common cause of chronic gastritis.
Attaching the microbial culture is extremely rare, and in most cases it is provided for the purposes of epidemiological or drug-resistant strains to determine which occur in the region. The indications for performing susceptibility testing of breeding is at least twice an unsuccessful eradication therapy [100], although even in this case, culture is not the norm. Most of the standard culture media used does not ensure the growth of bacteria [101].
The advantages of this method is the lower price survey, no need to have trained personnel and higher patient comfort [82], but it is less precise [83] [84] and requires testing in the microbiology laboratory, which is costly, time consuming and not very popular [81] .
He observed the characteristic spiral bacterium Vibrio and called them rugula.
Gastritis [edit | edit code] After getting into the stomach bacteria H. pylori induce acute phase inflammation of mucosal epithelial damage, decreased mucus production and a decrease in gastric acid secretion (hipochlorhydria). Damage to the epithelial cells causing compounds produced by H. pylori ammonia, protease A cytotoxin, and some phospholipase [41].
It has been suggested that H. pylori causes inflammation and locally raising the levels of TNF-α and / or interleukin-6
He also noted that this phenomenon is inhibited after the administration of antibiotics [8].
Typically, a stool sample is tested, the sensitivity of the test for the presence of bacterial DNA there is 50-60% [99].
Due to the need for specialized equipment, this study should not be the most popular.
Due to the low cost of diagnostic antibodies in the blood can be considered to be valuable for screening for the presence of bacteria in the body [88].
Several strains are known and the two genomes have been fully sequenced [143] [144] [145] [146] [147]. The genome of a strain of "26695" consists of 1.7 million base pairs of the 1550 genes.

7 Protection
700 000 - 1 500 000 individuals, now this number could increase. For this reason, the United States sent a petition to the CITES to remove the lynx in Annex II [8].

90 cm, including 10-18 cm tail [13]. The height at the withers is 36-38 cm [11].
To ensure adequate quality of life of the animal lynx ore, as found in Europe, Eurasian lynx, it must have at its disposal at least 20 square meters of space (this figure increases to 20% when you join the group of new individual), and if you live in a cage , it must be high for at least 2.5 meters.
A study of 15 subjects showed that survived for an average 62% of the young. After the statement of the results of other studies, it turned out that this number ranges from 56% to 67% [36]. In lynx was also observed cases of cannibalism occurring when the number of natural death is too small, but these are rare cases and have no significant impact on the number of animals [28].
Studies conducted in the Everglades show that the majority of victims (33 of 39) are the calves, but lynx can hunt an animal weighing eight times more than him. [26] Predator attacks usually when a deer lying down resting. Sacrifice kills biting the throat.
Research in Maine has shown little sign of rivalry between the lynx, coyote and fox ginger; distance between individuals belonging to the species and the area of ​​overlapping territories proved to be different for each observed in animals given time [27]. However, in the case of a Canadian lynx interspecific competition affects the placement of individuals, probably Competition excludes the coexistence of species prevented a further widening of the range of the Canadian lynx south [5].
Very good climbers, they can also swim, but usually avoid water [15].
Beard, lip and bottom of the body are usually whitish.
Characteristics [edit | edit code]
Although the red lynx is hunted humans, both for sport and for their fur, its population is considered good.
Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles and scarcity of food are other major causes of death lynx.
Claude Lévi-Strauss notes that the concept of twins representing opposites is characteristic of the mythology of the New World, but they are not the form, between which there is a balance, represent a rather open dualism, not symmetric duality of Old World cultures.
What unusual for cats, the males are more tolerant of representatives of their species, while females rarely enter other people's territories. [20] On the territory of one male can live several females.
What's more, the version appearing in the Nez Perce stories is much more complex, while the version of equality treats has lost, it seems, the original meaning of the story. [47]
Black pattern serves as camouflage.
Sometimes in late September may have a second litter.
Skull lynx bobcat
For example, version told by the Nez Perce Indians shows these animals as opposing beings [46]. Another version emphasizes their similarity.
The length of the trail is about 2-8 cm [32]. When the animal walks or runs trot, traces of the individual legs are spaced apart by about 20-46 cm.
For marking the site uses several methods: leave claw marks on trees, marked area faeces or urine.
The dominant male remains with the selected female and copulate with her a few times, usually in the winter and early spring. These animals infuse usually from February to March, although the time depends on where life lynx.
Adult lynx ore has few enemies except man, but can be killed during a fight with other predators.
An adult male measuring 70-120 cm, usually about
Fur is delicate and fragile, but it is quite long and thick.
Head of lynx bobcat
The boundaries of the area occupied by the lynx are labeled with urine, feces and claw marks on trees.
Other males may approach the pair, but do not try to sneak a male partner.
Like all cats, lynx bobcat tracks of the hind paws are usually completely covered with traces of the front.
Like most felines red lynx is a loner, but the areas of particular individuals often overlap.
Like most felines red lynx is an animal territorial and solitary, although the areas individuals may partially overlap.
Some suggest changes to the territories of males - from 41 km ² to 100 km ² in the winter [18].
It can take different fur color.
His ancestors appeared about 2.6 million years ago [5].
Its habitat includes both the Florida swamps and mountain areas. It can also live near human settlements, if it finds a suitable habitat [18].
It is smaller than the Canadian lynx and two times larger than a domestic cat.
It is, as suggested by Lévi-Strauss, the result of regular contact between Europeans and the indigenous inhabitants of those areas.
If there is one area many individuals, one female falls around
If you are hunting for a slightly larger animals, such as rabbits and hares, keeps track of hiding the victim waiting for this will be 6-10 feet away from him, and then moves to attack.
If the victims of the lynx population is small, kittens rarely reach adulthood.
Each den strong odor permeates the subject [18].
Each individual has a few hiding places - usually one main den and several secondary sites in remote parts of the area. Hideout this is usually a hole in a tree trunk, place in a thicket or cave under the rocks.
When food is scarce, often hunts for big sacrifices and retains part of the meat for later.
When the male senses that a female is fertile, copulate with her, holding her by the neck teeth.
When the territories of several males overlap, is determined supremacist hierarchy between them, resulting in the temporary removal may occur in some individuals with preferred area.
Kittens can be killed by owls, eagles, coyotes, foxes, and other adult lynx.
Kittens are born covered with fur and have already spots [11]. In Florida, caught a few melanistic individuals.
L. rufus baileyi (Merriam) southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico
L. rufus californicus (Mearns) California east of the Sierra Nevada
L. rufus escuinipae
L. rufus escuinipae subspecies occurring in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but in 2005, removed it from the list. [42]
L. rufus floridanus (Rafinesque) south-eastern USA and the inland part of the Mississippi valley to the south-western Missouri and southern Illinois L. rufus superiorensis
L. rufus oaxacensis (Goodwin) Oaxaca
L. rufus pallescens (Merriam) north-western United States and southern British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan
L. rufus peninsularis (Thomas) Baja California
L. rufus texensis (Mearns) Western Louisiana, eastern Texas, southern and central Oklahoma and south to Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon and Coahuila
This number shows large variations among different populations [37]. One species of mites - Lynxacarus Morla - occurs only on the body of the lynx redheads.
The young open their eyes after nine or ten days.
Young, who left his mother and started independent life, often die because they can not yet effectively hunt.
For the main victims of the lynx bobcat hunting and other medium-sized predators occupying the same ecological niche.
For small animals such as rodents, birds, fish and insects hunted in areas rich in these creatures.
In the south, it happens that lynx prey mainly on rodents.
In areas where both these kinds of sacrifices (as in New England) red lynx hunts on both the one and the other.
He gave it the name Felis rufus (Latin) = "cat ore" [4].
Most mammals caught weighing from about 0.7 to 5.7 kg.
Most hunts rabbits and hares, but it feeds on a variety of animals - from insects and small rodents, and deer and antelope pronghorn.
Most distinguished twelve [9] [10]:
The oldest observed lynx in the wild live 16 years in captivity 32 years [28].
Scientists have long could not reach an agreement, or red lynx should receive systematic name Lynx rufus rufus or Felis.
It is not known how many animals died from diseases and parasites, but it is likely that they cause more deaths from starvation, accidents and hunting [28].
The nose is pink-red, yellow eyes with black pupils [13].
The newborn kitten weighs 280-340 g, measures approx 25 cm.
Currently, the species occurs in most of its former territories. The animal disappeared from the Midwest of the United States, as well as areas in the Northeast, southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, Iowa and most of Missouri. Most likely it is related to the development of modern agriculture [18] [16] [14].
Currently Lynx is considered type, and lynx ore was classified in a taxonomy as Lynx rufus.
It is now considered as endangered lynx bobcat in the states of Ohio, Indiana and Iowa, but in 1999 he was removed from the list of endangered species in Illinois, Pennsylvania and in the same year from hunting and trapping to a limited extent is again permitted after the lifting of the prohibition in 1970 years.
Protection [edit | edit code]
It has long been appreciated him both as a source of fur, and the purpose of sport hunting, but still hunting and trapping continued high population level, even in the southern United States, where it hunts at him on a large scale.

Although these individuals are black, but they still can be seen the body of a characteristic pattern [12].
Couple during courtship can jump, chase and planted at each other.
After 60-70 days of gestation, in April or May, born from one to six, usually 2-4 kittens.
After lynx been shot deer do not eat the whole prey, but some buried under snow or leaves and returns to it several times to the feed [18].
After zagonieniu rabbit on the tree, lynx trying to make a fire, but the only thing that is achieved, the sparks burning with a fur coat and leaving him on the speckles [48]. Mohave Indians believe that the notorious dreams about things or animals allow them to acquire their skills.
During the race, red lynx takes great strides, which can be measured 1-3 m [33].
Subspecies of bobcat lynx rufus rufus L. (Schreber) eastern and mid-western U.S. L. rufus gigas
Hunting and diet [edit | edit code]
Hunted from ambush, jumping on the victim out of the closet or grasping after a short chase.
In addition, the animal must be provided with equipment to climb [44].
Bobcat lynx population falls in the Midwest of America, but overall it is in good condition
Bobcat lynx population in Canada is limited due to snow and the presence of the Canadian lynx. [40]
Lynx population also declined in the late nineteenth century in the state of New Jersey, mainly due to the development of agriculture and trade, which in turn resulted in dividing the territories of lynx by man-made objects such as roads and farmland.
Population in Canada and Mexico also is in good shape.
It has a characteristic black grille on the front paws and short tail with black transverse stripes.
Indirectly, kittens are more vulnerable to hunting, by its dependence on the mother in the first months of life. In the 70s and 80s
This issue was part of a larger debate - whether the four representatives of the lynx should be considered for the Lynx genus or subgenus in the genus Felis [5].
Sperm production begins each year in September or October, and the males remain fertile for early summer.
Cougars and wolves kill the lynx, which has been observed, inter alia, in Yellowstone Park. [35]
Sizes within each lynx redheads may differ considerably from each other. IUCN experts suggest that the size of the occupied territory can range from 0.6 to 326 km ² [16]. Research in Kansas has shown that male territory was usually around 20 km ², and a female - only half that size.
Reproduction and life cycle [edit | edit code]
Lynxes were also considered extinct in the states of New York and Pennsylvania, but recently there was a meeting with the individuals in these areas [39].
Lynx can carry external parasites, especially fleas and ticks, and often carry parasites that live on their victims, especially hares and squirrels.
Bobcats can be found on the outskirts of the areas inhabited by man, where human buildings adjacent to the wildlife [38]. If lynx attack dog or cat usually escapes to the tree [18]. The old areas of the Eurasian lynx bobcat included southern Canada, the United States, until the state of Oaxaca in Mexico.
Bobcats for the first time join the breeding usually during the second year of their lives, though females can give birth to small in the first year.
Bobcats came from other areas were much higher (around 57 km ²) and less marked territories.
Rude Lynxes live in the north and open spaces are the largest individuals of its species [16]. Comparison of morphological characteristics carried out in the eastern United States showed the greatest disparity in the distribution of males and females, suggesting that the selection of differentiating is limited by sex [17].
Rude Lynxes are not at a disadvantage during meetings with other kotowatymi: Nova Scotia observed seizure of territory by aggressive Canadian lynx lynx bobcat [16]. In northern and central Mexico, the cat lives among dry skrubu and forests of pine and oak; its range reaches the tropical southern outskirts of the country [16].
Rude Lynxes breed in winter and spring, pregnancy lasts two months.
Rude Lynxes spend their lives within a strictly limited territory, the size of which depends on the subject of gender and the amount of available prey.
Rude Lynxes also kill deer, especially in winter when smaller prey is difficult to access, or when the deer population is very large.
Rude Lynxes usually live six to eight years, sometimes live to ten.
Rude Lynxes live in the desert in the south west have lighter fur, while individuals living in the forests of the north are darker.

Bobcat is the smallest representative of the genus Lynx.
Bobcat is an animal leading nocturnal.
Bobcat can do without food for a long time, and can also eat at the same time large quantities of food.
Bobcat does not like the snow, because it does not have a characteristic broad Canadian lynx paws and consequently collapses in the bulk substrate.

Bobcat hunts animals of different sizes and adjusts to the size of the hunting technique of the victim.
Bobcat probably evolved from the Eurasian lynx, who came to America through Beringia during the Pleistocene.
Bobcat mythology [edit | edit code]
Bobcat in the tall grass, California
Bobcat, as a species in the family Felidae, is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species threatened with extinction [41], which means that it is not in immediate danger of extinction, but the hunt for him must be done under strict control .
Lynx rufus, in contrast to the Canadian lynx, not too picky in choosing the victim. [16] Studies have shown that the diet of these animals changes with the change in the number of lynx favorite victims [23].
Lynx rarely hunts for big game, such as foxes, skunks, mink, small dogs and cats [18]. These animals sometimes kill sheep and poultry.
The female may later go to another male [18], and males usually during one mating season have sex with several female partners [29]. During courtship usually quiet red lynx can emit loud screams, hisses and other sounds [30]. Research conducted in Texas suggest that lynx must be established territory, to be able to reproduce. The results show that males without their land were not young [31].
The female raises the young alone.
The female usually gives birth in an enclosed place in a small cave or hollow trunk.
The females are in heat at 44 days, the period of fertility it takes 10 days.

Independent life begins at the age of one year [18]. Despite this, in Michigan observed young remaining with his mother until the following spring [29].
Dreams of the lynx and the Pumi are, among others, help them build exceptional hunting skills [49]. European settlers also respected lynx bobcat, for his brutality and grace. [50]

You can also find him on a number of protected territories of the United States, its main area of ​​occurrence [16]. United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1988, estimated the number of lynx redheads in the U.S. for about
It becomes active about three hours before sunset and remains in this state until about midnight, then waking up at dawn.

Living Environment [edit | edit code]
As long as the red lynx can find for themselves the right environment, a person does not have a big impact on the region of their occurrence.
Taxonomy [Edit | Edit Code]
Territory and the social structure [edit | edit code]
This simple story in many versions, can be found in the culture of all the indigenous people of North America (Similar stories are also found in South America), although there are differences in detail.
Clues to the animal easily distinguished from trace cat after their size: one paw covers an area of ​​approximately
Clues [Edit | Edit code] Trace lynx bobcat paw print is four fingers without claws (lynx, like most felines, they can hide their claws).
Only extensive, highly urbanized areas are unsuitable for these cats [16].
Hides and waits until the victim herself approached him, and then pounces on her and grabs her with his claws.
The ears are speckled with black tips and short, black tufts of hair.
In 1972, the lynx ore was therefore covered by the full protection, and in 1991 it entered the list of threatened species [14].
During the day it traverses its territory 3-11 km [15]. This behavior can vary with season, as during winter lynx are more active during the day. This is due to the change in the habit of their victims, which in winter also become active during the day [14].
Nowadays, still carried catches are controlled, half of the deaths lynx is due to the cause.
In the legend, told by members of the tribe Szaunisów lynx is outwitted by a rabbit, which explains the characteristic pattern on the fur of a cat.
In the mythology of Native Americans and European settlers folklore is as elusive predator.
In Native American mythology, red lynx is often merged with a coyote, on the principle of duality [45]. Lynx and coyote are associating properly with the wind and fog - two elements representing opposites in Indian folklore.
In Poland, the lynx bobcat rearing conditions in zoos defined in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of 20 December 2004 on detailed conditions for rearing and breeding of particular groups of animals in zoos.
As a result, the highest mortality of these animals observed in the winter, during the hunting season. [28] Rude Lynxes in Poland [edit | edit code]
At the age of three to five months begin to wander with his mother. [30]
In the eastern United States are her rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus (including marsh rabbit and rabbit A Florida), the North American hares are.
According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service bobcats red in 2004, killed in U.S. 11 100 sheep, or 4.9% of the total number of animals killed by predators [24]. However, some cases may have been incorrectly classified as red lynx are often accused of attacks perpetrated by other animals [25].
Lynx population size depends on the number of potential victims.
The choice of main victims depends on the area where lynx live.
The choice depends on the victim's location, environment, season and number of animals.
It occurs on most of its original range of distribution.
It occurs in North America, in most of the continental United States from southern Canada to northern and central Mexico.
Twentieth century fur price rise sharply, resulting in increased hunting, but in the 90s prices dropped significantly [43].
The other shows that females, particularly those capable of reproduction and extend their areas in winter, but the males simply change their territory, and it does not expand, which is consistent with previous studies [20]. Other research in several U.S. states do not have territories or changes, these changes are small [19] [21] [22].
With szarobrązowym fur, whiskers and black tufts, red lynx is similar to other members of the genus Lynx.
Behavior [Edit | Edit Code]
Lynx population density of red shows large variations and can range from 1 to 38 individuals per 65 km ² [16]. Typically, for a lynx falls around
American Rabbit is the main victim of the lynx redheads.
It is usually gray-brown with black spots and black stripes on their hind legs and tail.
There are known cases of attacks on geese and sheep. Larger animals such as horses and cattle are not compromised.
Pupils are vertical, longitudinal, at night expand to increase the amount of light entering the eye [14]. Lynxes have heightened senses of sight and hearing, as well as a good sense of smell.
He lives in the wooded areas, as well as semi-deserts, urban areas and marshy.

Adopted son of Caesar, Augustus, used cipher shift shift one to the right, then instead of being the last in the alphabet letter X [3], posted double-A, as Suetonius writes:
Alphabet: AĄBCĆDEĘFGHIJKLŁMNŃOÓPRSŚTUWYZŹŻ
The encryption algorithm used in the code fragment Caesar is sometimes more complex encryption systems, such as Vigenere cipher.
American military historian David Kahn described in 1967 cases of lovers secretly communicating Caesar cipher coded messages in the pages of The Times. [12]
Without careful analysis it is immediately apparent that the decoding of text occurs at offset 5 There is another way to use such a table.
D_n (s) \ equiv y - n \ PMOD {32}
Decryption is to reverse the operation.
The resulting content decryption
For the Latin alphabet should be number 26. [3]
For text in natural language most often only one key gives a clear result, although some very short messages can not be unambiguously break without knowing the key.
E_n (x) \ equiv x + n \ PMOD {32},
where x is the number of letters in the plaintext alphabet, E_n (x) - the number of ciphertext letters in the alphabet.
Whenever uses a cipher, B puts instead of A, C instead of B, and That same manner placed next letter, instead of X - double A [8].
Historical information [edit | edit code] cipher name comes from Julius Caesar, who used a cipher shifting shift equal to 3
Information on the cipher used by Caesar came, among others, from Suetonius:
Another type of brute force attack is to match the frequency distribution of letters.
There are sources saying that Caesar also used a more complex encryption systems [9].
This is the type of substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext (unencrypted) is replaced away from her by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet of another letter (cipher monoalfabetyczny), the direction of the conversion must be preserved.
If the keyword is random and of a length not less than the message itself, then it is a cipher with a key single, unbreakable, provided the key to maintain the secrecy.
If someone wanted to explore and investigate the code, each letter would substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet in turn, ie D, substitute A, and so change the rest [6].
Key shorter than the message (such as words Complete Victory used by the Confederacy during the Civil War) carries a repeating pattern that can be detected by sophisticated analysis techniques the frequency [15].
Cryptanalysis [edit | edit code]
Number 32 above is the number of letters in the alphabet Polish.
It is used in toys type of secret decoder ring (two adjacent and rotatable relative to each other rings printed with consecutive letters of the alphabet), and the combination of offset 13, so-called. ROT13 is used as a simple method of hiding content (eg, the punch line of jokes and plot endings - called. Spoilers), widely distributed in Unix systems [14].
It can easily break even when the ciphertext is available only insofar as one of the following:
On a parchment bearing the ciphertext Kuzu Kuzu BMUKSZ, which after decoding (in the Hebrew alphabet) gives YHVH YHVH ELHYNU.
On the basis of the properties of congruence and that E_n (x), D_n (s) is in the range 0 .. 31:
For example, in the Polish language most commonly used in the texts of the letters A, I, O, E, and the characteristic created by the system is not visible in the distribution of the majority of sufficiently long ciphertexts [21].
For example, the encoded text "WAE" can be decoded with the word "CAT" or "FISH" (given that the plaintext language is Polish), the same ciphertext "ŻYAH" to "truce" or "Rosa" and the text "DIFBA" on "darkness" or "Ryton".
It should be noted that the last letters of the alphabet at the top over the corresponding initial letters in the bottom (alphabet was "wrapped").
In contrast, the letters themselves cryptogram contain the divine name, which was supposed to protect against evil spirits. [11]
The name is derived from the cipher of Julius Caesar, who probably used this technique to communicate with their friends.
Cipher name comes from Julius Caesar, the Roman general and politician.
There are no sources saying the technique of fracture simple substitution ciphers in antiquity.
No distinction is made with the letters big and small.
The first documented methods of breaking ciphers such by the Arab philosopher al-Kindi from the ninth century, when they began to use the frequency analysis [16].
After adjusting individual letters of the strips to the ciphertext, the decoded text will be visible in one of the stacked rows.
Under each letter of the ciphertext are printed in reverse order prior to the letters in the alphabet.
Because there are a finite number of possible shifts (32 in Polish), each combination can be tested brute force attack [18]. One way to do this is to print the portion of the encrypted text in a table together with all its possible shifts [19] - a technique sometimes called "laying overt element" (called completing the plain component) [20]. Let the example ciphertext will DŹDŃŚADRMI.
Shift
Example [edit | edit code] The encryption can be represented by a diagram with the corresponding two strings each successive letters of the alphabet.
Quote-alpha.png Quotiens car per notas scribit, B Pro A, C, B ac pro deinceps eadem ratione sequentis litteras ponit; Pro X car duplex A [7].

Caesar cipher "moves" the resolution, so that at sufficiently long text, it is possible to determine the encryption offset by alignment of the distribution of letters in szyfrogramie to this plot.
Caesar cipher is also present today.
Caesar cipher with a shift to the left one was used on the back of mezuzot to encode the Hebrew names of God (saved after turning the parchment of 180 °, by order of the letters has been preserved on the other side).
Vigenere cipher Caesar cipher is, however, a variable offset for each position in the text.
Cipher: CĆDEĘFGHIJKLŁMNŃOÓPRSŚTUWYZŹŻAĄB
Encrypt a private correspondence to his friends, saved Latin, using the shift cipher with a key 3
Also Gelliusz Roman writer refers to the EC Treaty (now lost) on the cipher Roman general [10].
The same points of the second series are offset relative to its first position by a specified number, called the offset parameter (here, 2) and acts as a cipher key:
Plain text: brave, OR, PROTECT YOUR REGIMENT AND SIX FLAG
Recognition of mathematical [edit | edit code]
Using mathematical terms this can be expressed as follows: the set of all Caesar cipher with different keys creates a cyclic group because an encryption operations [23].
In a more advanced version of statistical methods may be used for calculating the extent to which the frequency distribution of the sample corresponds to the expected degradation, for example by a test chi-square [22]. Such research uses statistical cryptanalysis.
In the second case, the Caesar cipher is even easier to break.
In the first case the code can be easily broken by the use of the same techniques that are used to crack other substitution ciphers, such as statistical attack [17]. It is very likely that the person who wants to decipher the text quickly will recognize a pattern in szyfrogramie and concludes that was used to encode the Caesar cipher.
To achieve this, each letter of the alphabet clearly attributed to the number of Scheme A ↔ 0, ¥ ↔ 1, B ↔ 2, ..., ¯ ↔ 31 Also it is convenient to assume that key n is a number in the range 0 .. 31 (the number is encrypted letter A).
In the nineteenth century the heading classified ads in newspapers were sometimes used to transmit encrypted messages simple codes.
The offset is defined by any keyword.
According to some authorities, is a remnant of a time when Jews were not allowed to have a mezuzah.
known (or suspected to) that uses a simple substitution cipher, but it is not known whether this is Caesar cipher;
it is known that using the Caesar cipher, but it is unknown shift, which is used to encode messages.
Multiple encoding the same content Caesar cipher does not increase security, because the two encryption operations, for example, shift 3 and shift 5 are equivalent encoding shift 3 +5 = 8
Today, the Caesar cipher is used with offset 13 (ROT13), which is a simple and fast way to hide the contents.
Chart frequency of Polish letters of the alphabet in a text written in Polish has a distinctive and predictable shape.
With Caesar's code were used even in 1915. The army of the Russian Empire has used him as a replacement for the more complex ciphers that were too difficult to learn for the Russian army, so that German and Austrian cryptanalysts had no major problems with reading these messages [13].
For this reason, sometimes a cipher Caesar cipher is defined only moving shift 3, and the deadline for shifting cipher is reserved for the general case [4].
Also preserved his letters to Cicero, to close friends in domestic matters, where things that require secrecy gave cipher, ie as ułożywszy series of letters that could not be with them to create any expression.
